  # To test building GAP both using the bundled libraries (zlib and GMP), as
  # well as using the versions distributed with cygwin, we do the former in
  # the 32 bit build and the latter in the 64 bit build. But building zlib
  # does not see to work if '--coverage' is used, so we only use that flag in
  # the 64 bit build.
