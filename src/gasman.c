**
**  This file contains  the functions of  Gasman,  the  GAP  storage manager.
**
**  {\Gasman} is a storage manager for applications written in C.  That means
**  that  an application  using {\Gasman}  requests  blocks  of  storage from
**  {\Gasman}.   Those   blocks of  storage are    called  *bags*.  Then  the
**  application writes data into and reads data from the bags.  Finally a bag
**  is no longer needed  and the application  simply forgets it.  We say that
**  such a bag that is no longer needed is *dead*.  {\Gasman} cares about the
**  allocation of bags and deallocation of  dead bags.  Thus these operations
**  are  transparent    to  the application,  enabling   the    programmer to
**  concentrate on algorithms instead of caring  about storage allocation and
**  deallocation.
**
**  {\Gasman} implements an automatic, cooperating, compacting, generational,
**  conservative storage management
**
**  *Automatic* means that the application only allocates  bags.  It need not
**  explicitly  deallocate them.    {\Gasman} automatically determines  which
**  bags are  dead and deallocates them.  This   is done by a  process called
**  *garbage  collection*.   Garbage refers to   the bags that  are dead, and
**  collection refers to the process of deallocating them.
**
**  *Cooperating* means  that the application  must cooperate with {\Gasman},
**  that is it must follow two rules.  One rule is that  it must not remember
**  the addresses of the data area of a bag for  too long.  The other rule is
**  that it must inform {\Gasman} when it has changed a bag.
**
**  *Compacting* means that after a garbage collection {\Gasman} compacts the
**  bags  that are   still  live,  so  that the  storage  made  available  by
**  deallocating the dead  bags  becomes one  large  contiguous  block.  This
**  helps to avoid *fragmentation* of the free storage.  The downside is that
**  the address of  the data  area  of a  bag  may  change during  a  garbage
**  collection,  which is the  reason why  the  application must not remember
**  this address for too long,  i.e., must not keep  pointers to or into  the
**  data area of a bag over a garbage collection.
**
**  *Generational*  means that {\Gasman}  distinguishes between old and young
**  bags.  Old bags have been allocated some time ago, i.e., they survived at
**  least one garbage collection.  During a garbage collection {\Gasman} will
**  first find and  deallocate the dead young  bags.   Only if that  does not
**  produce enough free storage, {\Gasman} will find  and deallocate the dead
**  old  bags.  The idea behind this  is that usually most  bags  have a very
**  short life, so  that  they will die young.    The downside is that   this
**  requires {\Gasman} to quickly  find  the young  bags that are  referenced
**  from   old bags, which  is  the  reason  why  an  application must inform
**  {\Gasman} when it has changed a bag.
**
**  *Conservative* means that there are  situations in which {\Gasman} cannot
**  decide with  absolute certainty whether  a bag is   still live or already
**  dead.  In these situations {\Gasman} has to  assume that the bag is still
**  live, and may thus keep a bag longer than it is necessary.
**
**  What follows describes the reasons for this  design, and at the same time
**  the assumptions that were  made about the application.   This is given so
**  you can make an educated guess as to whether  {\Gasman} is an appropriate
**  storage manager for your application.
**
**  {\Gasman} is automatic, because  this makes it  easier to use in large or
**  complex applications.  Namely in with a non-automatic storage manager the
**  application must  decide when  to  deallocate  a  bag.  This  requires in
**  general global knowledge, i.e., it is not sufficient  to know whether the
**  current function may still need  the bag, one also  needs to know whether
**  any  other  function may  still   need the   bag.  With growing   size or
**  complexity of the application it gets harder to obtain this knowledge.
**
**  {\Gasman} is cooperating,  because this is  a requirement  for compaction
**  and generations (at least without cooperation, compaction and generations
**  are very  difficult).  As described  below, the  former is  important for
**  storage efficiency,   the  latter for  time efficiency.     Note that the
**  cooperation requires only local knowledge, i.e., whether or not a certain
**  function of the application follows the two  rules can be decided by just
**  looking   at the function  without any  knowledge about the   rest of the
**  application.
**
**  {\Gasman} is  compacting, because this allows the  efficient usage of the
**  available storage by applications where the ratio between the size of the
**  smallest   and the largest bag is   large.   Namely with a non-compacting
**  storage manager,  a  part  of  the free  storage   may become unavailable
**  because it is fragmented into  many small pieces,  each  of which is  too
**  small to serve an allocation.
**
**  {\Gasman} is generational,  because this  makes it  very much faster,  at
**  least  for those  applications where   most bags  will indeed  die young.
**  Namely a non-generational storage manager must test  for each bag whether
**  or  not it  is still live  during  each garbage collection.  However with
**  many applications  the probability   that  an  old bag,  i.e.,  one  that
**  survived at least one  garbage  collection, will  also survive  the  next
**  garbage  collection  is  high.   A  generational  storage manager  simply
**  assumes that each old bag is still  live during most garbage collections.
**  Thereby it avoids  the expensive tests for most  bags during most garbage
**  collections.
**
**  {\Gasman}  is conservative, because  for most applications  only few bags
**  are incorrectly  assumed to be still live  and the additional cooperation
**  required   to make  {\Gasman} (more)     precise   would slow down    the
**  application.  Note that the problem appears since the C compiler provides
**  not enough information to distinguish between true references to bags and
**  other values  that just happen to look  like  references.  Thus {\Gasman}
**  has to assume that everything that could be interpreted as a reference to
**  a bag  is  indeed such  a reference, and  that  this bag is  still  live.
**  Therefore  some bags  may  be  kept by  {\Gasman}, even   though they are
**  already dead.

*F  WORDS_BAG( <size> ) . . . . . . . . . . words used by a bag of given size
**
**  The structure of a bag is a follows{\:}
**
**    <identifier>
**      __/
**     /
**    V
**    +---------+
**    |<masterp>|
**    +---------+
**          \________________________
**                                   \
**                                    V
**    +------+-------+------+---------+--------------------------------+----+
**    |<size>|<flags>|<type>|  <link> |         .         .         ...| pad|
**    +------+-------+------+---------+--------------------------------+----+
**
**  A bag consists of a masterpointer, and a body.
**
**  The *masterpointer* is a pointer  to the data  area of the bag.  During a
**  garbage collection  the masterpointer is the  only active  pointer to the
**  data area of the bag, because of the rule that no pointers to or into the
**  data  area of a  bag may be remembered  over calls  to functions that may
**  cause a garbage  collection.  It is the job  of the garbage collection to
**  update the masterpointer of a bag when it moves the bag.
**
**  The *identifier*  of  the  bag is a   pointer  to (the  address   of) the
**  masterpointer  of  the bag.   Thus   'PTR_BAG(<bag>)' is simply '\*<bag>'
**  plus a cast.
**
**  The *body* of a bag consists of a header, the data area, and the padding.
**
**  The header in turn consists of the *type byte*, *flags byte* and the
**  *size field*, which is either 32 bits or 48 bits (on 32 resp. 64 bit systems),
**  followed by a link word.  The 'BagHeader' struct describes the exact
**  structure of the header.
**
**  The  *link word* usually   contains the identifier of  the  bag,  i.e., a
**  pointer to the masterpointer of the bag.  Thus the garbage collection can
**  find  the masterpointer of a  bag through the link  word if  it knows the
**  address of the  data area of the bag.    The link word   is also used  by
**  {\Gasman} to  keep   bags  on  two linked  lists  (see  "ChangedBags" and
**  "MarkedBags").
**
**  The *data area* of a  bag is the area  that  contains the data stored  by
**  the application in this bag.
**
**  The *padding* consists  of up to 'sizeof(Bag)-1' bytes  and pads the body
**  so that the size of a  body is always  a multiple of 'sizeof(Bag)'.  This
**  is to ensure that bags are always aligned.  The macro 'WORDS_BAG(<size>)'
**  returns the number  of words occupied  by the data  area and padding of a
**  bag of size <size>.
**
**  A body in the workspace whose type byte contains the value T_DUMMY is the
**  remainder of a 'ResizeBag'. That is it consists either of the unused words
**  after a bag has been shrunk, or of the old body of the bag after the
**  contents of the body have been copied elsewhere for an extension. The
**  size field in the bag header contains the number of bytes in
**  this area excluding the first word itself. Note that such a body  has no
**  link  word, because such a remainder does not correspond to a bag (see
**  "Implementation of ResizeBag").
**
**  A masterpointer with a value  congruent to 1  mod 4 is   the relic of  an
**  object  that was  weakly but not   strongly  marked in  a recent  garbage
**  collection.   These persist until  after the next full garbage collection
**  by which time all references to them should have been removed.

**  MptrBags    MptrEndBags  OldBags   YoungBags         AllocBags    EndBags
**
**  The *masterpointer area*  contains  all the masterpointers  of  the bags.
**  'MptrBags' points to the beginning of this area and 'MptrEndBags' to the
**  end.
**
**  Between MptrEndBags and OldBags is an *unused area*. This exists so the
**  master points, and bags area, can be moved independently. MptrEndBags
**  will always come earlier in memory than OldBags. GASMAN should not touch
**  this memory, as it may be used for other purposes.
**
**  The *old bags area* contains the bodies of all the  bags that survived at
**  least one  garbage collection.  This area is  only  scanned for dead bags
**  during a full garbage collection.  'OldBags'  points to the  beginning of
**  this area and 'YoungBags' to the end.
**
**  The *young bags area* contains the bodies of all  the bags that have been
**  allocated since the  last garbage collection.  This  area is scanned  for
**  dead  bags during  each garbage  collection.  'YoungBags'  points  to the
**  beginning of this area and 'AllocBags' to the end.
**
**  The *allocation area* is the storage  that is available for allocation of
**  new bags.  When a new bag is allocated the storage for  the body is taken
**  from  the beginning of   this area,  and  this  area  is  correspondingly
**  reduced.   If  the body does not   fit in the  allocation  area a garbage
**  collection is  performed.  'AllocBags' points   to the beginning of  this
**  area and 'EndBags' to the end.
**
**  Note that  the  borders between the areas are not static.  In  particular
**  each allocation increases the size of the young bags area and reduces the
**  size of the  allocation area.  On the other hand each garbage  collection
**  empties the young bags area.

**
**  'ChangedBags' holds a  list of old bags that  have been changed since the

**  or which have been resized.
**
**  This list starts with the bag  whose identifier is 'ChangedBags', and the
**  link word of each bag on the list contains the identifier of the next bag
**  on the list.  The link word of the  last bag on the list  contains 0.  If
**  'ChangedBags' has the value 0, the list is empty.
**
**  The garbage collection needs to know which young  bags are subbags of old
**  bags, since  it  must  not  throw   those away    in a partial    garbage
**  collection.  Only  those old bags that  have been changed  since the last
**  garbage collection can contain references to  young bags, which have been
**  allocated since the last garbage  collection.  The application cooperates
**  by informing {\Gasman} with 'CHANGED_BAG' which bags it has changed.  The
**  list of changed old  bags is scanned by a  partial garbage collection and
**  the young subbags of the old bags on this list are marked with 'MarkBag'
**  (see "MarkedBags").  Without this  list 'CollectBags' would have to  scan
**  all old bags for references to young bags, which would take too much time
**  (see "Implementation of CollectBags").
**
**  'CHANGED_BAG' puts a bag on the list  of changed old bags.  'CHANGED_BAG'
**  first checks that <bag> is an old bag by checking that 'PTR_BAG( <bag> )'
**  is smaller than 'YoungBags'.  Then it checks that  the bag is not already
**  on the list of changed bags by checking that the link word still contains
**  the identifier of <bag>.  If <bag> is an  old bag that  is not already on
**  the list of changed bags, 'CHANGED_BAG' puts <bag> on the list of changed
**  bags,  by  setting  the  link word of   <bag>   to the   current value of

**
**  'MarkedBags' holds a list of bags that have already  been marked during a
**  garbage collection by 'MarkBag'.  This list is only used  during garbage
**  collections, so it is  always empty outside  of  garbage collections (see
**  "Implementation of CollectBags").
**
**  This list starts with the  bag whose identifier  is 'MarkedBags', and the
**  link word of each bag on the list contains the identifier of the next bag
**  on the list.  The link word of the  last bag on the list  contains 0.  If
**  'MarkedBags' has the value 0, the list is empty.
**
**  Note that some other  storage managers do not use  such a list during the
**  mark phase.   Instead  they simply let the  marking   functions call each
**  other.  While this is  somewhat simpler it  may use an unbound  amount of
**  space on the stack.  This is particularly  bad on systems where the stack
**  is not in a separate segment of the address space, and thus may grow into
**  the workspace, causing disaster.
**
**  'MarkBag'   puts a  bag <bag>  onto  this list.    'MarkBag'  has to be
**  careful, because it can be called  with an argument that  is not really a
**  bag identifier, and may  point  outside the programs  address space.   So
**  'MarkBag' first checks that <bag> points  to a properly aligned location
**  between 'MptrBags' and 'OldBags'.   Then 'MarkBag' checks that <bag>  is
**  the identifier  of a young bag by  checking that the masterpointer points
**  to  a  location between  'YoungBags'  and  'AllocBags'  (if <bag>  is the
**  identifier of an   old bag, the  masterpointer will  point to a  location
**  between  'OldBags' and 'YoungBags',  and if <bag>   only appears to be an
**  identifier, the masterpointer could be on the free list of masterpointers
**  and   point   to a  location  between  'MptrBags'  and  'OldBags').  Then
**  'MarkBag' checks  that <bag> is not  already marked by checking that the
**  link  word of <bag>  contains the identifier of the   bag.  If any of the
**  checks fails, 'MarkBag' does nothing.  If all checks succeed, 'MarkBag'
**  puts <bag> onto the  list of marked bags by  putting the current value of
**  'ChangedBags' into the link word  of <bag>  and setting 'ChangedBags'  to
**  <bag>.  Note that since bags are always placed  at the front of the list,
**  'CollectBags' will   mark the bags   in a  depth-first  order.   This  is

 * GAP_MEM_CHECK
 *
 * One of the hardest categories of bugs to fix in GAP are where
 * a reference to the internals of a GAP object are kept across
 * a garbage collection (which moves GAP objects around).
 *
 * GAP_MEM_CHECK provides a method of detecting such problems, at
 * the cost of GREATLY decreased performance (Starting GAP in
 * --enableMemCheck mode takes days, rather than seconds).
 *
 * The fundamental idea behind GAP_MEM_CHECK is, whenever NewBag
 * or ResizeBag is called, then the contents of every Bag in
 * GAP is moved, and the memory previously being used is marked
 * as not readable or writable using 'mprotect'.
 *
 * Actually copying all GAP's memory space would be extremely
 * expensive, so instead we use 'mmap' to set up a set of copies
 * of the GAP memory space, which are represented by the same
 * underlying physical memory.
 *
 * The 0th such copy (which we also ensure is the one at the
 * lowest memory address) is special -- this is where we
 * reference the master pointers (which can't move). We do not
 * 'mprotect' any of this memory.
 *
 * Every time we call 'NewBag' or 'ResizeBag', we change which
 * copy of the GASMAN memory space the master pointers point
 * to, disabling access to the previous copy, and enabling access
 * to the new one.
 *
 * We never use the master pointers in any copy other than the
 * 0th, and we never refer to the Bag area in the 0th copy. However,
 * it simplifies things to not try to seperate the master pointer
 * and Bag areas, because the master pointer area can grow as GAP
 * runs.
 *
 * Because this code is VERY slow, it can be turned on and off.
 * At run time, call GASMAN_MEM_CHECK(1) to enable, and
 * GASMAN_MEM_CHECK(0) to disable. Start GAP with --enableMemCheck
 * to enable from when GAP starts.

**
**  Then it  writes  the  size and the   type  into the word   pointed to  by
**  'AllocBags'.  Then  it writes the identifier,  i.e.,  the location of the
**  masterpointer, into the next word.
**
**  Then it advances 'AllocBags' by '2 + WORDS_BAG(<size>)'.

/****************************************************************************
**
*F  ResizeBag(<bag>,<new>)  . . . . . . . . . . . .  change the size of a bag
**
**  Basically 'ResizeBag' is rather  simple, but there  are a few  traps that
**  must be avoided.
**
**  If the size of the bag changes only a little bit, so that  the  number of
**  words needed for the data area does not  change, 'ResizeBag' only changes
**  the size word of the bag.
**
**  If  the bag  is  to be  shrunk  and at  least   one  word becomes   free,
**  'ResizeBag'  changes  the  size word of  the bag, and stores a magic
**  size-type word in  the first free word.  This  magic size-type  word  has
**  type T_DUMMY and the size is the number of following free bytes, which is
**  always divisible by 'sizeof(Bag)'. The type T_DUMMY allows 'CollectBags'
**  to detect that this body is the remainder of a resize operation, and the
**  size allows  it  to know how  many  bytes  there  are  in this  body (see
**  "Implementation of CollectBags").
**
**  So for example if 'ResizeBag' shrinks a bag of type 7 from 18 bytes to 10
**  bytes the situation before 'ResizeBag' is as follows{\:}
**
**    +---------+
**    |<masterp>|
**    +---------+
**         \_____________
**                       \
**                        V
**    +---------+---------+--------------------------------------------+----+
**    | 18  . 7 |  <link> |         .         .         .         .    | pad|
**    +---------+---------+--------------------------------------------+----+
**
**  And after 'ResizeBag' the situation is as follows{\:}
**
**    +---------+
**    |<masterp>|
**    +---------+
**         \_____________
**                       \
**                        V
**    +---------+---------+------------------------+----+-------------+-----+
**    | 10  . 7 |  <link> |         .         .    | pad| 4 . T_DUMMY |     |
**    +---------+---------+------------------------+----+-------------+-----+
**
**  If the bag is to be extended and it  is that last  allocated bag, so that
**  it  is  immediately adjacent  to the allocation  area, 'ResizeBag' simply
**  increments  'AllocBags' after making  sure that enough space is available
**  in the allocation area (see "Layout of the Workspace").
**
**  If the bag  is to be   extended and it  is not  the  last allocated  bag,
**  'ResizeBag'  first allocates a  new bag  similar to 'NewBag', but without
**  using  a new masterpointer.   Then it copies the old  contents to the new
**  bag.  Finally it resets the masterpointer of the bag to  point to the new
**  address. Then it changes the type of the old body to T_DUMMY, so that the
**  garbage collection can detect that this body is the remainder of a resize
**  (see "Implementation of NewBag" and "Implementation of CollectBags").
**
**  When an old bag is extended, it  will now reside  in the young bags area,
**  and thus appear  to be young.   Since old bags are   supposed to  survive
**  partial garbage  collections 'ResizeBag'  must   somehow protect this bag
**  from partial garbage collections.  This is  done by putting this bag onto
**  the linked  list  of  changed bags (see   "ChangedBags").  When a partial
**  garbage collection sees a young bag on the list of changed bags, it knows
**  that it is the result of 'ResizeBag' of an old bag, and does not throw it
**  away (see "Implementation of CollectBags").  Note  that  when 'ResizeBag'
**  tries this, the bag may already be on the linked  list, either because it
**  has been resized earlier, or because  it has been  changed.  In this case
**  'ResizeBag' simply keeps the bag on this linked list.
**
**  If {\Gasman}  was compiled with the  option 'COUNT_BAGS' then 'ResizeBag'
**  also updates the information in 'InfoBags' (see "InfoBags").

/****************************************************************************
**
*F  CollectBags( <size>, <full> ) . . . . . . . . . . . . . collect dead bags
**
**  'CollectBags' is the function that does most of the work of {\Gasman}.
**
**  A partial garbage collection where  every bag is  young is clearly a full
**  garbage    collection.  So  to     perform  a  full  garbage  collection,
**  'CollectBags' first sets 'YoungBags'  to   'OldBags', making every    bag
**  young, and empties the list  of changed old bags, since  there are no old
**  bags anymore, there  can be no changed old  bags anymore.  So from now on
**  we    can   assume that  'CollectBags'     is doing   a  partial  garbage
**  collection.   In  addition,    the   values 'NewWeakDeadBagMarker'    and
**  'OldWeakDeadBagMarker'  are exchanged, so  that bag identifiers that have
**  been  halfdead  since    before  this full    garbage  collection can  be
**  distinguished from those which have died on this pass.
**
**  Garbage collection  is  performed in  three phases.  The  mark phase, the
**  sweep phase, and the check phase.
**
**  In the  *mark phase*, 'CollectBags' finds  all young bags that  are still
**  live and builds a linked list of those bags (see "MarkedBags").  A bag is
**  put on  this  list  of  marked bags   by   applying  'MarkBag' to    its
**  identifier.  Note that 'MarkBag' checks that a bag is not already on the
**  list of marked bags, before it puts it on the list, so  no bag can be put
**  twice on this list.
**
**  First, 'CollectBags' marks  all  young bags that are  directly accessible
**  through global   variables,  i.e.,  it   marks those young     bags whose
**  identifiers  appear  in  global variables.   It    does this  by applying
**  'MarkBag'  to the values at the  addresses  of global variables that may
**  hold bag identifiers provided by 'InitGlobalBag' (see "InitGlobalBag").
**
**  Next,  'CollectBags' marks  all  young bags  that are directly accessible
**  through   local  variables, i.e.,    it  marks those  young   bags  whose
**  identifiers appear in the  stack.   It  does  this by calling  the  stack
**  marking  function  <stack-func>  (see  "InitBags").   The   generic stack
**  marking function, which is called if <stack-func> (see "InitBags") was 0,
**  is described below.  The problem is  that there is usually not sufficient
**  information  available to decide  if a value on   the stack is really the
**  identifier of a bag, or is a  value of another  type that only appears to
**  be the  identifier  of a bag.  The  position  usually taken by  the stack
**  marking function is that everything  on the stack  that could possibly be
**  interpreted  as the identifier of  a bag is an  identifier of  a bag, and
**  that this bag is therefore live.  This position is what makes {\Gasman} a
**  conservative storage manager.
**
**  The generic stack marking function 'GenStackFuncBags', which is called if
**  <stack-func> (see "InitBags") was 0, works by  applying 'MarkBag' to all
**  the values on the stack,  which is supposed to extend  from <stack-start>
**  (see  "InitBags") to the address of  a local variable of   the  function.
**  Note that some local variables may  not  be stored on the  stack, because
**  they are  still in the processors registers.    'GenStackFuncBags' uses a
**  jump buffer 'RegsBags', filled by the C library function 'setjmp', marking
**  all bags  whose  identifiers appear in 'RegsBags'.  This  is a dirty hack,
**  that need not work, but actually works on a  surprisingly large number of
**  machines.  But it will not work on Sun  Sparc machines, which have larger
**  register  files, of which  only the part  visible to the current function
**  will be saved  by  'setjmp'.  For those machines 'GenStackFuncBags' first
**  calls the operating system to flush the whole register file.  Note that a
**  compiler may save  a register  somewhere else  if   it wants to  use this
**  register for something else.  Usually  this register is saved  further up
**  the  stack,  i.e.,   beyond the   address  of  the  local variable,   and
**  'GenStackFuncBags' would not see this value any more.   To deal with this
**  problem, 'setjmp' must be called *before* 'GenStackFuncBags'  is entered,
**  i.e.,  before the  registers may have been saved  elsewhere.   Thus it is
**  called from 'CollectBags'.
**
**  Next 'CollectBags' marks all young bags that are directly accessible from
**  old bags, i.e.,  it marks all young bags  whose identifiers appear in the
**  data areas  of  old bags.  It  does  this by applying 'MarkBag'  to each
**  identifier appearing in changed old bags, i.e., in those bags that appear
**  on the list of changed old bags (see "ChangedBags").   To be more precise
**  it calls the  marking function for the appropriate  type to  each changed
**  old bag (see "InitMarkFuncBags").  It need not apply the marking function
**  to each old  bag, because old bags that  have not been changed  since the
**  last garbage  collection cannot contain identifiers  of young bags, which
**  have been allocated since the last garbage collection.  Of course marking
**  the subbags of only  the changed old  bags is more efficient than marking
**  the subbags of  all old bags only  if the number of  changed old  bags is
**  smaller than the total number of old bags, but this  is a very reasonable
**  assumption.
**
**  Note that there may also be bags that  appear to be  young on the list of
**  changed old bags.  Those bags  are old bags that  were extended since the
**  last garbage  collection and therefore have their  body in the young bags
**  area (see "Implementation of  ResizeBag").  When 'CollectBags' finds such
**  a bag  on  the list of  changed  old bags  it  applies 'MarkBag'  to its
**  identifier and thereby  ensures that this bag will  not be thrown away by
**  this garbage collection.
**
**  Next,  'CollectBags'    marks all  young    bags  that  are  *indirectly*
**  accessible, i.e., it marks the subbags of  the already marked bags, their
**  subbags  and  so on.  It  does  so by walking   along the list of already
**  marked bags and applies  the marking function  of the appropriate type to
**  each bag on this list (see  "InitMarkFuncBags").  Those marking functions
**  then apply 'MarkBag' or 'MarkBagWeakly'  to each identifier appearing in
**  the bag.
**
**  After  the marking function has  been  applied to a   bag on the list  of
**  marked bag, this bag is removed from the list.  Thus the marking phase is
**  over when the list  of marked bags   has become empty.  Removing the  bag
**  from the list of marked  bags must be done  at  this time, because  newly
**  marked bags are *prepended* to the list of  marked bags.  This is done to
**  ensure that bags are marked in a  depth first order, which should usually
**  improve locality of   reference.  When a bag is   taken from the list  of
**  marked bags it is *tagged*.  This tag serves two purposes.  A bag that is
**  tagged is not put on the list  of marked bags  when 'MarkBag' is applied
**  to its identifier.  This ensures that  no bag is put  more than once onto
**  the list of marked bags, otherwise endless marking loops could happen for
**  structures that contain circular  references.  Also the sweep phase later
**  uses the presence of  the tag to decide the  status of the bag. There are
**  three possible statuses: LIVE, DEAD and  HALFDEAD. The default state of a
**  bag with its identifier in the link word, is  the tag for DEAD. Live bags
**  are tagged    with  MARKED_ALIVE(<identifier>)  in the   link   word, and
**  half-dead bags (ie bags pointed to weakly but not strongly) with the tage
**  MARKED_HALFDEAD(<identifier>).
**
**  Note that 'CollectBags' cannot put a random or magic  value into the link
**  word, because the sweep phase must be able to find the masterpointer of a
**  bag by only looking at the link word of a bag. This is done using the macros
**  UNMARKED_XXX(<link word contents>).
**
**  In the   *sweep  phase*, 'CollectBags'   deallocates all dead   bags  and
**  compacts the live bags at the beginning of the workspace.
**
**  In this  phase 'CollectBags'   uses  a destination pointer   'dst', which
**  points to  the address a  body  will be copied to,   and a source pointer
**  'src',  which points to the address  a body currently has.  Both pointers
**  initially   point to  the   beginning  of  the   young bags area.    Then
**  'CollectBags' looks at the body pointed to by the source pointer.
**
**  If this body has type T_DUMMY, it is the remainder of a resize operation.
**  In this case 'CollectBags' simply moves the source pointer to the next
**  body (see "Implementation of ResizeBag").
**
**
**  Otherwise, if the  link word contains the  identifier of the bag  itself,

**  marked dead,  'CollectBags' first adds the masterpointer   to the list of
**  available masterpointers (see  "FreeMptrBags") and then simply  moves the
**  source pointer to the next bag.
**
**  Otherwise, if the link  word contains  the  identifier of the  bag marked
**  alive, this   bag is still  live.  In  this case  'CollectBags' calls the
**  sweeping function for this bag, if one  is installed, or otherwise copies
**  the body from  the source address to the  destination address, stores the
**  address of the masterpointer   without the tag  in   the link word,   and
**  updates the masterpointer to point to the new address of the data area of
**  the bag.   After the copying  the source pointer points  to the next bag,
**  and the destination pointer points just past the copy.
**
**  Finally, if the link word contains the identifier of  the bag marked half
**  dead, then  'CollectBags' puts  the special value  'NewWeakDeadBagMarker'
**  into the masterpointer corresponding to the bag, to signify that this bag
**  has been collected as garbage.
**
**  This is repeated until  the source pointer  reaches the end of  the young
**  bags area, i.e., reaches 'AllocBags'.
**
**  The new free storage now is the area between  the destination pointer and
**  the source pointer.  If the initialization flag  <dirty> (see "InitBags")
**  was 0, this area is now cleared.
**
**  Next, 'CollectBags' sets   'YoungBags'  and 'AllocBags'  to   the address
**  pointed to by the destination  pointer.  So all the  young bags that have
**  survived this garbage  collection are now  promoted  to be old  bags, and
**  allocation of new bags will start at the beginning of the free storage.
**
**  Finally, the *check phase* checks  whether  the garbage collection  freed
**  enough storage and masterpointers.
**
**  After a partial garbage collection,  'CollectBags' wants at least '<size>
**  + AllocSizeBags' bytes  of free  storage  available, where <size> is  the
**  size of the bag that 'NewBag' is  currently trying to allocate.  Also the
**  number  of free masterpointers should be  larger than the  number of bags
**  allocated since   the  previous garbage collection  plus 4096  more to be
**  safe.   If less free   storage  or  fewer masterpointers  are  available,
**  'CollectBags' calls itself for a full garbage collection.
**
**  After a  full  garbage collection,  'CollectBags' wants at   least <size>
**  bytes of free storage available, where <size> is the size of the bag that
**  'NewBag' is  currently trying  to allocate.  Also it  wants  at least one
**  free  masterpointer.    If less free    storage or   no masterpointer are
**  available, 'CollectBags'  tries   to   extend  the  workspace   using the
**  allocation   function <alloc-func> (see    "InitBags").   If <alloc-func>
**  refuses  to extend  the   workspace,  'CollectBags' returns 0 to indicate
**  failure to 'NewBag'.  In  any case 'CollectBags' will  try to  extend the
**  workspace so that at least one eigth of the storage is free, that is, one
**  eight of the storage between 'OldBags' and 'EndBags' shall be  free.   If
**  <alloc-func> refuses this extension of the workspace, 'CollectBags' tries
**  to get along with  what it  got.   Also 'CollectBags' wants at least  one
**  masterpointer per 8 words of free storage available.  If  this is not the
**  case, 'CollectBags'  extends the masterpointer area  by moving the bodies
**  of all bags and readjusting the masterpointers.
**
**  Also,  after   a  full  garbage   collection,  'CollectBags'   scans  the
**  masterpointer area for  identifiers containing 'OldWeakDeadBagMarker'. If
**  the sweep functions have done their work then no  references to these bag
**  identifiers can exist, and so 'CollectBags' frees these masterpointers.

// exact cases, as it is never incorrect to mark something changed.
//
// For completeness and future reference here are the necessary points to
// consider.
//
// When swapping two master pointers, we have to take into account whether the
// bags they refer are on the ChangedBags list, as we otherwise may end up in an
// inconsistent state, where a bag is referenced, but GASMAN does not know this.
// GASMAN then collects this bag, resulting in a corrupted workspace.
//
// We consider the following three cases:
//
// 1. Both bags are old. Then if the original bag1 had been previously marked as
//    changed (by having been put into the ChangedBags singly linked list), then
//    we must make sure to mark the new bag2 as changed, too (and vice-versa).
//
// 2. Both bags are young. Then they typically will not be on the list of
//    changed bags, as CHANGED_BAGS just skips them.
//    However, while CHANGED_BAG will never put a young bag on the list of
//    changed bags, young bags can still be put on the ChangedBags list in
//    step 3, so we need to do something similar as in step 1.
//
// 3. bag1 is young and bag2 is old (or vice-versa), then after swapping, bag1
//    is old and bag2 is young, as the 'young'ness moves with the contents, so
//    we must mark bag1 changed if bag2 was previously changed.
//
//    More importantly, bag2 is now young, but the only references to bag2 might
//    be in an old bag, that is not marked changed. Thus bag2 would get
//    (incorrectly) collected, because these bags are not considered in a
//    garbage collection.
//
//    To avoid this we force bag2 onto the ChangedBags list, but we can't use
//    CHANGED_BAG, as it skips young bags.
