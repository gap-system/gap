*F  SyNanosecondsSinceEpoch()
**
**  'SyNanosecondsSinceEpoch' returns a 64-bit integer which represents the
**  number of nanoseconds since some unspecified starting point. This means
**  that the number returned by this function is not in itself meaningful,
**  but the difference between the values returned by two consecutive calls
**  can be used to measure wallclock time.
**
**  The accuracy of this is system dependent. For systems that implement
**  clock_getres, we could get the promised accuracy.
**
**  Note that gettimeofday has been marked obsolete in the POSIX standard.
**  We are using it because it is implemented in most systems still.
**
**  If we are using gettimeofday we cannot guarantee the values that
**  are returned by SyNanosecondsSinceEpoch to be monotonic.
**
**  Returns -1 to represent failure
