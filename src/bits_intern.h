*F  CopyBits( <fromblock>, <from-starting-bit>, <toblock>, <to-starting-bit>,

**
**  'CopyBits' copies <numbits> bits (numbering bits within a UInt
**   from the least significant to the most significant) starting with
**   bit number <from-starting-bit> of UInt *<fromblock> to a destination
**   starting at bit <to-starting-bit> of *<toblock>. The source and
**   destination are assumed to be non-overlapping.
**
**   The full function is provided as an inline function here because it is
**   used in both blister.c and vecgf2.c and the compiler can do significant
**   optimisations if some or all of <frombits>, <tobits> and <numbits> are
**   known at compile time.
