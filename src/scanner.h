*T  TypSymbolSet  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . type of sets of symbols
**
**  'TypSymbolSet' is the type of sets of symbols.  Sets  of symbols are used
**  in the error recovery of the  parser  to specify that 'Match' should skip
**  all symbols until finding one in a specified set.
**
**  If there were less than 32 different symbols  things would be  very easy.
**  We could  simply assign   the  symbolic constants   that are the possible
**  values for 'Symbol' values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...  and so on.  Then making a
**  set  would  simply mean  or-ing the  values, as in  'S_INT|S_STRING', and
**  checking whether a symbol is in a set would be '(<symbol> & <set>) != 0'.
**
**  There  are however more  than 32 different  symbols, so  we must  be more
**  clever.  We  group some  symbols that  are syntactically  equivalent like
**  '*', '/' in a class. We use the least significant 3 bits to differentiate
**  between members in one class.  And now  every symbol class, many of which
**  contain   just  one  symbol,  has exactly  one   of  the  remaining most
**  significant 29  bits  set.   Thus   sets  of symbols  are  represented as
**  unsigned long integers, which is typedef-ed to 'TypSymbolSet'.
**
**  The classes are as follows, all other symbols are in a class themself:
**      identifiers, IsBound, Unbind, Info, Assert
**      if, for, repeat, while, return
**      elif, else
**      not, and, or
**      =, <>, <, >=, <=, >, in
**      +, -

**  'SyntaxError' is called from the parser to print error messages for those

**  or if two formal arguments of a function have the same identifier.

**
*F  Match( <symbol>, <msg>, <skipto> )  . match current symbol and fetch next
**
**  'Match' is the main  interface between the  scanner and the  parser.   It
**  performs the four most common actions in the scanner with  just one call.
**  First it checks that  the current symbol stored  in the variable 'Symbol'
**  is the expected symbol  as passed in the  argument <symbol>.  If  it  is,
**  'Match' reads the next symbol from input  and returns.  Otherwise 'Match'
**  first prints the current input line followed by the syntax error message:
**  '^ syntax error, <msg> expected' with '^' pointing to the current symbol.
**  It then  skips symbols up to one  in the resynchronisation  set <skipto>.
**  Actually 'Match' calls 'SyntaxError' so its comments apply here too.
**
**  One kind of typical 'Match' call has the form
**
**      'Match( Symbol, "", 0 );'.
**
**  This is used if the parser knows that the current  symbol is correct, for
**  example in 'ReadReturn'  the  first symbol must be 'S_RETURN',  otherwise
**  'ReadReturn' would not have been called. Called this  way 'Match' will of
**  course never raise a syntax error, therefore <msg> and <skipto> are of no
**  concern.  The effect of this call is  merely to read the next symbol from
**  input.
**
**  Another typical 'Match' call is in 'ReadIf' after we read the if symbol
**  and the condition following, and now expect to see the 'then' symbol:
**
**      Match( S_THEN, "then", STATBEGIN|S_ELIF|S_ELSE|S_FI|follow );
**
**  If the current symbol  is 'S_THEN' it is  matched  and the next symbol is
**  read.  Otherwise 'Match'  prints the  current line followed by the  error
**  message: '^ syntax error, then expected'.  Then 'Match' skips all symbols
**  until finding either  a symbol  that can begin  a statment,  an 'elif' or
**  'else' or 'fi' symbol, or a symbol that is  contained in the set <follow>
**  which is passed to 'ReadIf' and contains all symbols allowing  one of the
**  calling functions  to resynchronize,  for example 'S_OD' if 'ReadIf'  has
**  been called from 'ReadFor'. <follow> always contain 'S_EOF', which 'Read'
**  uses to resynchronise.
**
**  If 'Match' needs to  read a  new line from  '*stdin*' or '*errin*' to get
**  the next symbol it prints the string pointed to by 'Prompt'.
