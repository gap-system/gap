**  This file declares the functions of the scanner, which is responsible for
**  all input and output processing.
**
**  The scanner  exports two very  important abstractions.  The  first is the
**  concept that an input file is  a stream of symbols,  such nasty things as
**  <space>,  <tab>,  <newline> characters or  comments (they are worst  :-),
**  characters making  up identifiers  or  digits that  make  up integers are
**  hidden from the rest of GAP.
**
**  The second is  the concept of  a current input  and output file.   In the
**  main   module   they are opened  and   closed  with the  'OpenInput'  and
**  'CloseInput' respectively  'OpenOutput' and 'CloseOutput' calls.  All the
**  other modules just read from the  current input  and write to the current
**  output file.
**
**  The scanner relies on the functions  provided  by  the  operating  system
**  dependent module 'system.c' for the low level input/output.

*T  TypSymbolSet  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . type of sets of symbols
**
**  'TypSymbolSet' is the type of sets of symbols.  Sets  of symbols are used
**  in the error recovery of the  parser  to specify that 'Match' should skip
**  all symbols until finding one in a specified set.
**
**  If there were less than 32 different symbols  things would be  very easy.
**  We could  simply assign   the  symbolic constants   that are the possible
**  values for 'Symbol' values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...  and so on.  Then making a
**  set  would  simply mean  or-ing the  values, as in  'S_INT|S_STRING', and
**  checking whether a symbol is in a set would be '(<symbol> & <set>) != 0'.
**
**  There  are however more  than 32 different  symbols, so  we must  be more
**  clever.  We  group some  symbols that  are syntactically  equivalent like
**  '*', '/' in a class. We use the least significant 3 bits to differentiate
**  between members in one class.  And now  every symbol class, many of which
**  contain   just  one  symbol,  has exactly  one   of  the  remaining most
**  significant 29  bits  set.   Thus   sets  of symbols  are  represented as
**  unsigned long integers, which is typedef-ed to 'TypSymbolSet'.
**
**  The classes are as follows, all other symbols are in a class themself:
**      identifiers, IsBound, UnBind, Info, Assert
**      if, for, repeat, while, return
**      elif, else
**      not, and, or

*F  Match( <symbol>, <msg>, <skipto> )  . match current symbol and fetch next
**
**  'Match' is the main  interface between the  scanner and the  parser.   It
**  performs the  4 most common actions in  the scanner  with  just one call.
**  First it checks that  the current symbol stored  in the variable 'Symbol'
**  is the expected symbol  as passed in the  argument <symbol>.  If  it  is,
**  'Match' reads the next symbol from input  and returns.  Otherwise 'Match'
**  first prints the current input line followed by the syntax error message:
**  '^ syntax error, <msg> expected' with '^' pointing to the current symbol.
**  It then  skips symbols up to one  in the resynchronisation  set <skipto>.
**  Actually 'Match' calls 'SyntaxError' so its comments apply here too.
**
**  One kind of typical 'Match' call has the form
**
**      'Match( Symbol, "", 0L );'.
**
**  This is used if the parser knows that the current  symbol is correct, for
**  example in 'RdReturn'  the   first symbol must be 'S_RETURN',   otherwise
**  'RdReturn' would not have been  called.  Called this  way 'Match' will of
**  course never raise an syntax error,  therefore <msg>  and <skipto> are of
**  no concern, they are passed nevertheless  to please  lint.  The effect of
**  this call is merely to read the next symbol from input.
**
**  Another typical 'Match' call is in 'RdIf' after we read the if symbol and
**  the condition following, and now expect to see the 'then' symbol:
**
**      Match( S_THEN, "then", STATBEGIN|S_ELIF|S_ELSE|S_FI|follow );
**
**  If the current symbol  is 'S_THEN' it is  matched  and the next symbol is
**  read.  Otherwise 'Match'  prints the  current line followed by the  error
**  message: '^ syntax error, then expected'.  Then 'Match' skips all symbols
**  until finding either  a symbol  that can begin  a statment,  an 'elif' or
**  'else' or 'fi' symbol, or a symbol that is  contained in the set <follow>
**  which is passed to  'RdIf' and contains  all symbols allowing  one of the
**  calling functions to resynchronize, for example 'S_OD' if 'RdIf' has been
**  called from 'RdFor'.  <follow>  always contain 'S_EOF', which 'Read' uses
**  to resynchronise.
**
**  If 'Match' needs to  read a  new line from  '*stdin*' or '*errin*' to get
**  the next symbol it prints the string pointed to by 'Prompt'.

**  <filename> is  closed again, input will be  taken again from  the current
**  input file.
**
**  Test mode works as follows.  If the  scanner is about  to print a line to
**  the current output  file (or to be  more precise to  the output file that
**  was current when  'OpenTest' was called) this  line is compared with  the
**  next line from the test  input file, i.e.,  the one opened by 'OpenTest'.
**  If this line does not start  with  'gap>' and the rest  of it matches the
**  output line the output line is not printed and the  input comment line is
**  discarded.   Otherwise the scanner  prints the  output  line and does not
**  discard the input line.
**
**  On the other hand if an input line is encountered on  the test input that
**  does not start with 'gap>'  the scanner assumes that  this is an expected
**  output  line that  did not appear  and  echoes  this line  to the current
**  output file.
**
**  The upshot is that you  can write test files  that consist of alternating
**  input starting with 'gap>' and lines the expected output.  If GAP behaves
**  normal and produces the expected output then  nothing is printed.  But if
**  something  goes wrong  you  see what actually   was printed and what  was
**  expected instead.
**
**  As a convention GAP test files should start with:
**
**    gap> START_TEST("%Id%");
**
**  where the '%' is to be replaced by '$' and end with
