**
*F  SyAllocBags( <size>, <need> ) . . . allocate memory block of <size> kilobytes
**
**  'SyAllocBags' is called from Gasman to get new storage from the operating
**  system. <size> is the needed amount in kilobytes (it is always a multiple
**  of 512 KByte), and <need> tells 'SyAllocBags' whether Gasman really needs
**  the storage or only wants it to have a reasonable amount of free storage.
**
**  Currently  Gasman  expects this function to return  immediately  adjacent
**  areas on subsequent calls.  So 'sbrk' will  work  on  most  systems,  but
**  'malloc' will not.
**
**  If <need> is 0, 'SyAllocBags' must return 0 if it cannot or does not want
**  to extend the workspace,  and a pointer to the allocated area to indicate
**  success.   If <need> is 1  and 'SyAllocBags' cannot extend the workspace,
**  'SyAllocBags' must abort,  because GAP assumes that  'NewBag'  will never
**  fail.
**
**  <size> may also be negative in which case 'SyAllocBags' should return the
**  storage to the operating system.  In this case  <need>  will always be 0.
**  'SyAllocBags' can either accept this reduction and  return 1  and  return
**  the storage to the operating system or refuse the reduction and return 0.
**
**  If the operating system does not support dynamic memory management, simply
**  give 'SyAllocBags' a static buffer, from where it returns the blocks.
