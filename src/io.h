*F  OpenInput( <filename> ) . . . . . . . . . .  open a file as current input
**
**  'OpenInput' opens  the file with  the name <filename>  as  current input.
**  All  subsequent input will  be taken from that  file, until it is  closed
**  again  with 'CloseInput'  or  another file  is opened  with  'OpenInput'.
**  'OpenInput'  will not  close the  current  file, i.e., if  <filename>  is
**  closed again, input will again be taken from the current input file.
**
**  'OpenInput'  returns 1 if  it   could  successfully open  <filename>  for
**  reading and 0  to indicate  failure.   'OpenInput' will fail if  the file
**  does not exist or if you do not have permissions to read it.  'OpenInput'
**  may  also fail if  you have too  many files open at once.   It  is system
**  dependent how many are  too many, but  16  files should  work everywhere.
**
**  Directely after the 'OpenInput' call the variable  'Symbol' has the value
**  'S_ILLEGAL' to indicate that no symbol has yet been  read from this file.
**  The first symbol is read by 'Read' in the first call to 'Match' call.
**
**  You can open  '*stdin*' to  read  from the standard  input file, which is
**  usually the terminal, or '*errin*' to  read from the standard error file,
**  which  is  the  terminal  even if '*stdin*'  is  redirected from  a file.
**  'OpenInput' passes those  file names  to  'SyFopen' like any other  name,
**  they are  just  a  convention between the  main  and the system  package.
**  'SyFopen' and thus 'OpenInput' will  fail to open  '*errin*' if the  file
**  'stderr'  (Unix file  descriptor  2)  is  not a  terminal,  because  of a
**  redirection say, to avoid that break loops take their input from a file.
**
**  It is not neccessary to open the initial input  file, 'InitScanner' opens
**  '*stdin*' for  that purpose.  This  file on   the other   hand  cannot be
**  closed by 'CloseInput'.
