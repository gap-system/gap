*S  GAP_PATH_MAX . . . . . . . . . . . .  size for buffers storing file paths
**
**  'GAP_PATH_MAX' is the default buffer size GAP uses internally to store
**  most paths. If any longer paths are encountered, they will be either
**  truncated, or GAP aborts.
**
**  Note that no fixed buffer size is sufficient to store arbitrary paths
**  on contemporary operating systems, as paths can have arbitrary length.
**  This also means that the POSIX constant PATH_MAX does not really do the
**  job its name would suggest (nor do MAXPATHLEN, MAX_PATH etc.).
**
**  Writing POSIX compliant code without a hard coded buffer size is rather
**  challenging, as often there is no way to find out in advance how large a
**  buffer may need to be. So you have to start with some buffer size, then
**  check for errors; if 'errno' equals 'ERANGE', double the buffer size and
**  repeat, until you succeed or run out of memory.
**
**  Instead of going down this road, we use a fixed buffer size after all.
**  This way, at least our code stays simple. Also, this is what most (?)
**  code out there does, too, so if somebody actually uses such long paths,
**  at least GAP won't be the only program to run into problems.
