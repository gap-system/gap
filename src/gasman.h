**  This file declares  the functions of  Gasman,  the  GAP  storage manager.
**
**  {\Gasman} is a storage manager for applications written in C.  That means
**  that an application requests blocks  of storage from {\Gasman}, which are
**  called bags.   After using a bag   to store data,  the application simply
**  forgets the  bag,  and  we  say that  such a  block  is dead.   {\Gasman}
**  implements   an   automatic,  cooperating,   compacting,    generational,
**  conservative storage manager.  Automatic  means that the application only
**  allocates  bags,   but need  not  explicitly   deallocate them.   This is
**  important for large or  complex application, where explicit  deallocation
**  is difficult.  Cooperating means  that the allocation must cooperate with
**  {\Gasman}, i.e., must follow certain rules.  This information provided by
**  the   application makes  {\Gasman}   use  less  storage and   run faster.
**  Compacting  means that {\Gasman} always compacts  live bags such that the
**  free storage is  one large block.  Because  there is  no fragmentation of
**  the  free  storage   {\Gasman} uses   as   little storage   as  possible.
**  Generational  means  that {\Gasman}  usually assumes  that bags that have
**  been live for some  time are still live.  This   means that it can  avoid
**  most of the tests whether a bag is still live or already dead.  Only when
**  not enough storage can be reclaimed under this assumption does it perform
**  all the  tests.  Conservative means  that {\Gasman} may  keep bags longer
**  than necessary because   the  C compiler   does  not provide   sufficient
**  information to distinguish true references to bags from other values that
**  happen to  look like references.

*T  Bag . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . type of the identifier of a bag
**
**  'Bag'
**
**  Each bag is identified by its  *bag identifier*.  That  is each bag has a
**  bag identifier and no  two live bags have the  same identifier.  'Bag' is
**  the type of bag identifiers.
**
**  0 is a  valid value of the type  'Bag', but is guaranteed  not to be  the
**  identifier of any bag.
**
**  'NewBag'  returns  the identifier of   the newly   allocated bag and  the
**  application passes this identifier to every {\Gasman} function to tell it
**  which bag  it should  operate  on (see "NewBag",  "TNUM_BAG", "SIZE_BAG",
**  "PTR_BAG", "CHANGED_BAG", "RetypeBag", and "ResizeBag").
**
**  Note that the  identifier of a  bag is different from  the address of the
**  data area  of  the  bag.  This  address  may   change during  a   garbage
**  collection while the identifier of a bag never changes.
**
**  Bags  that contain references  to   other bags  must  always contain  the
**  identifiers of these other bags, never the addresses of the data areas of
**  the bags.
**
**  Note that bag identifiers are recycled.  That means that after a bag dies
**  its identifier may be reused for a new bag.

**
**  'PTR_BAG' returns the address of the data area of the bag with identifier
**  <bag>.  Using  this pointer the application  can then  read data from the
**  bag or write  data  into it.  The  pointer   is of  type pointer  to  bag
**  identifier, i.e., 'PTR_BAG(<bag>)[0]' is   the  identifier of the   first
**  subbag of the bag, etc.  If the bag contains  data in a different format,
**  the  application has  to  cast the pointer  returned  by 'PTR_BAG', e.g.,
**  '(long\*)PTR_BAG(<bag>)'.
**
**  Note  that the address  of the data area  of a  bag  may change  during a
**  garbage collection.  That is  the  value returned by 'PTR_BAG' may differ
**  between two calls, if 'NewBag', 'ResizeBag', 'CollectBags', or any of the
**  application\'s functions  or macros that may   call   those functions, is
**  called in between (see "NewBag", "ResizeBag", "CollectBags").
**
**  The first rule for using {\Gasman} is{\:} *The  application must not keep
**  any pointers to or into the data area of any  bag over calls to functions
**  that may cause a garbage collection.*
**
**  That means that the following code is incorrect{\:}
**
**      ptr = PTR_BAG( old );
**      new = NewBag( typeNew, sizeNew );
**      *ptr = new;
**
**  because  the creation of  the new bag may  move the  old bag, causing the
**  pointer to  point  no longer to  the  data area of  the bag.   It must be
**  written as follows{\:}
**
**      new = NewBag( typeNew, sizeNew );
**      ptr = PTR_BAG( old );
**      *ptr = new;
**
**  Note that even the following is incorrect{\:}
**
**      PTR_BAG(old)[0] = NewBag( typeNew, sizeNew );
**
**  because a C compiler is free to compile it to  a sequence of instructions
**  equivalent to first example.  Thus whenever  the evaluation of a function
**  or  a macro  may cause a  garbage collection  there  must be   no call to
**  'PTR_BAG' in the same expression, except as argument  to this function or
**  macro.
**
**  Note that  after writing   a bag  identifier,  e.g.,  'new' in the  above
**  example, into the  data area of another  bag, 'old' in the above example,
**  the application  must inform {\Gasman}  that it  has changed  the bag, by
**  calling 'CHANGED_BAG(old)' in the above example (see "CHANGED_BAG").
**
**  Note that 'PTR_BAG' is a macro, so  do  not call it with  arguments  that
**  have side effects.

/****************************************************************************
**
*F  CHANGED_BAG(<bag>)  . . . . . . . .  notify Gasman that a bag has changed
**
**  'CHANGED_BAG( <bag> )'
**
**  'CHANGED_BAG'  informs {\Gasman} that the bag   with identifier <bag> has
**  been changed by an assignment of another bag identifier.
**
**  The  second rule for using  {\Gasman} is{\:} *After  each assignment of a
**  bag identifier into a  bag the application  must inform {\Gasman} that it
**  has changed the bag before the next garbage collection can happen.*
**
**  Note that the  application need not inform {\Gasman}  if it changes a bag
**  by assigning something that is not an identifier of another bag.
**
**  For example to copy all entries from  one list into another the following
**  code must be used{\:}
**
**      for ( i = 0; i < SIZE-BAG(old)/sizeof(Bag); i++ )
**          PTR_BAG(new)[i] = PTR_BAG(old)[i];
**      CHANGED_BAG( new );
**
**  On the other  hand  when the  application  allocates a matrix,  where the
**  allocation of each row may cause a garbage collection, the following code
**  must be used{\:}
**
**      mat = NewBag( T_MAT, n * sizeof(Bag) );
**      for ( i = 0; i < n; i++ ) {
**          row = NewBag( T_ROW, n * sizeof(Bag) );
**          PTR_BAG(mat)[i] = row;
**          CHANGED_BAG( mat );
**      }
**
**  Note that  writing 'PTR_BAG(mat)[i] = NewBag( T_ROW, n\*\ sizeof(Bag) );'
**  is incorrect as mentioned in the section for 'PTR_BAG' (see "PTR_BAG").
**
**  Note that 'CHANGED_BAG' is a macro, so do not call it with arguments that

**
**  <type> must be a  value  between 0 and 253.    The types 254 and  255 are

**  'TNUM_BAG'    and change   it  with  'RetypeBag'     (see  "TNUM_BAG" and
**  "RetypeBag").
**
**  It is probably a good idea to define symbolic constants  for all types in
**  a  system wide   header  file,  e.g.,  'types.h', if   only  to avoid  to
**  accidently use the same value for two different types.
**
**  <size> is the size of the new bag in bytes and must be a value  between 0
**  and $2^{32}-1$ (on 32 bit systems)  resp. $2^{48}-1$ (on 64 bit systems).
**  The application can find the size of a bag with 'SIZE_BAG' and change  it
**  with 'ResizeBag' (see "SIZE_BAG" and "ResizeBag").

**  'SizeLiveBags' is  the total size of bags  that were  live after the last
**  garbage collection.  So after a full garbage  collection it is simply the
**  total size of bags that have been found to  be still live by this garbage
**  collection.  After  a partial  garbage  collection it  is the sum  of the
**  previous value of  'SizeLiveBags', which is the total   size of live  old
**  bags, and the total size of bags that have been found to be still live by
**  this garbage  collection,  which is  the  total size of  live young bags.
**  This value is used in the information messages.
**
**  'NrDeadBags'
**
**  'NrDeadBags' is  the number of bags that died since the last full garbage
**  collection.   So after a  full garbage  collection this is zero.  After a
**  partial  garbage  collection it  is  the  sum  of the  previous value  of
**  'NrDeadBags' and the  number of bags that  have been found to be dead  by
**  this garbage collection.  This value is used in the information messages.

**  be a function of  three 'unsigned  long'  arguments <full>,  <phase>, and
**  <nr>.   <msgs-func> should format  this information and  display it in an
**  appropriate way.   In fact you will usually  want to ignore  the messages
**  for partial  garbage collections, since there are  so many  of those.  If
**  you do not install a  messages  function  with  'InitMsgsFuncBags',  then
**  'CollectBags' will be silent.
**
**  If <full> is 1, the current garbage collection is a full one.  If <phase>
**  is 0, the garbage collection has just started and  <nr> should be ignored
**  in this case.  If <phase> is 1 respectively 2, the garbage collection has
**  completed the mark phase  and <nr> is  the total number  respectively the
**  total  size of live bags.   If <phase> is  3  respectively 4, the garbage
**  collection  has completed  the  sweep  phase,   and <nr>  is   the number
**  respectively the total size of bags that died since the last full garbage
**  collection.  If <phase> is  5 respectively 6,  the garbage collection has
**  completed the check phase   and <nr> is    the size of the free   storage
**  respectively the size of the workspace.  All sizes are measured in KByte.
**
**  If  <full> is 0,  the current garbage  collection  is a  partial one.  If
**  <phase> is 0, the garbage collection has just  started and <nr> should be
**  ignored  in  this  case.  If  <phase>  is 1  respectively 2,  the garbage
**  collection  has   completed the  mark   phase  and  <nr>   is the  number
**  respectively the  total size  of bags allocated  since  the last  garbage
**  collection that  are still  live.   If <phase> is  3 respectively  4, the
**  garbage collection has completed  the sweep phase and  <nr> is the number
**  respectively the   total size of   bags allocated since  the last garbage
**  collection that are already dead (thus the sum of the values from phase 1
**  and 3  is the  total number of   bags  allocated since the  last  garbage
**  collection).  If <phase> is 5 respectively 6,  the garbage collection has
**  completed the  check phase  and <nr>  is   the size of  the  free storage
**  respectively the size of the workspace.  All sizes are measured in KByte.
**
**  The message  function  should display   the information  for each   phase
**  immediatly, i.e.,  by calling 'flush' if the  output device is a file, so
**  that the user has some indication how much time each phase used.
**
**  For example {\GAP} displays messages for  full garbage collections in the
**  following form{\:}
**
**    #G  FULL  47601/ 2341KB live  70111/ 5361KB dead   1376/ 4096KB free
**
**  where 47601 is the total number of bags surviving the garbage collection,
**  using 2341 KByte, 70111 is  the total number  of bags that died since the
**  last full garbage  collection, using 5361  KByte, 1376 KByte are free and
**  the total size of the workspace is 4096 KByte.
**
**  And partial garbage collections are displayed in  {\GAP} in the following
**  form{\:}
**
**    #G  PART     34/   41KB+live   3016/  978KB+dead   1281/ 4096KB free
**

**  using {\Gasman} before any bags can be allocated.
**
**  <alloc-func> must  be the function that  {\Gasman}  uses to  allocate the
**  initial workspace and to extend the workspace.  It must accept two 'long'
**  arguments  <size> and <need>.   <size> is  the amount of  storage that it
**  must allocate, and <need>  indicates  whether {\Gasman} really needs  the
**  storage or only wants it to have a reasonable amount of free storage.

**  *Currently   this function must  return    immediately adjacent areas  on
**  subsequent  calls*.  So 'sbrk'  will  work on most  systems, but 'malloc'
**  will not.
**
**  If  <need> is 0,  <alloc-func> must  either  return  the  address of  the
**  extension to indicate success or return  0 if it  cannot or does not want

**  or abort if it cannot or does not  want  to  extend the workspace.   This
**  choice determines  whether  'NewBag'  and  'ResizeBag' may  fail.  If  it
**  returns 0, then  'NewBag' and  'ResizeBag' can fail.  If  it aborts, then
**  'NewBag' and 'ResizeBag' can never fail (see "NewBag" and "ResizeBag").
**
**  <size>  may also be   negative if {\Gasman} has   a large amount  of free
**  space, and wants to return  some of it  to the operating system.  In this
**  case <need>   will  always be  0.   <alloc-func>  can either  accept this
**  reduction of  the  workspace and return  a nonzero  value  and return the
**  storage to the operating system, or refuse this reduction and return 0.
**
**  <initial-size> must be the size of  the initial workspace that 'InitBags'
**  should allocate.  This   value is automatically rounded   up to the  next
**  multiple of 1/2 MByte by 'InitBags'.
**
**  <stack-func>  must be   a    function    that  applies  'MarkBag'   (see
**  "InitMarkFuncBags") to each possible bag identifier on the application\'s
**  stack, i.e., the stack where the applications local variables  are saved.
**  This should be a function of no  arguments  and return type 'void'.  This
**  function   is  called  from  'CollectBags'  to  mark   all bags  that are
**  accessible from  local variables.   There  is a generic function for this
**  purpose, which is called  when the application passes  0 as <stack-func>,
**  which will work all right on most machines, but *may* fail on some of the

**
**  If the application passes 0 as value for <stack-func>, <stack-start> must
**  be the start of the stack.   Note that the  start of the  stack is either
**  the bottom or the top of the stack, depending  on whether the stack grows
**  upward  or downward.  A  value that usually works is  the address  of the
**  argument  'argc'   of the  'main' function    of the  application,  i.e.,
**  '(Bag\*)\&argc'.  If  the application   provides  another   <stack-func>,
**  <stack-start> is ignored.
**
**  If the application passes 0 as value for <stack-func>, <stack-align> must
**  be  the alignment  of items  of  type 'Bag' on the  stack.   It must be a
**  divisor of 'sizeof(Bag)'.  The addresses of  all identifiers on the stack
**  must be a multiple  of <stack-align>.  So if  it is 1, identifiers may be
**  anywhere on the stack, and  if it is  'sizeof(Bag)', identifiers may only
**  be at addresses that are a multiple of 'sizeof(Bag)'.  This value depends
**  on  the   machine,  the  operating system,   and   the compiler.   If the
**  application provides another <stack-func>, <stack-align> is ignored.
**
**  The initialization  flag  <dirty> determines  whether  bags allocated  by
**  'NewBag' are initialized to contain only 0 or not.   If <dirty> is 0, the
**  bags are  initialized to  contain only 0.    If  <dirty> is  1, the  bags
**  initially contain  random values.  Note that {\Gasman}  will be  a little
**  bit faster if bags need not be initialized.
**
**  <abort-func> should be a function that {\Gasman} should call in case that
**  something goes  wrong, e.g.,     if it  cannot allocation    the  initial
**  workspace.  <abort-func> should be a function of one string argument, and
**  it  might want to display this   message before aborting the application.
**  This function should never return.
