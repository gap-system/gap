**  this case 'SetList' is equal to 'ShallowCopy'.
**
**  'SetList' makes a copy  of the list  <list>, removes the holes, sorts the

*F  IsSet(<list>) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . test if a list is a set
**
**  'IsSet' returns 1 if the list <list> is a proper set  and 0 otherwise.  A
**  proper set is a list that has no holes, no duplicates, and is sorted.  As
**  a side effect 'IsSet' may changes the type of proper sets.
**
**  A typical call in the set functions looks like this:                   \\
**  |    if ( ! IsSet(list) )  list = SetList(list); |                     \\
**  This tests if 'list' is a proper set.  If it is, then the type is changed
**  to reflect this. If it is not then 'SetList' is called to make a copy of
**  'list', remove the holes, sort the copy, and remove the duplicates.
