*F  InitSweepFuncBags(<type>,<sweep-func>)  . . . . install sweeping function
**
**  'InitSweepFuncBags' installs the function <sweep-func> as sweeping
**  function for bags of type <type>.
**
**  A sweeping function is a function that takes two arguments src and dst of
**  type Bag *, and  a third, length of type  UInt, and returns nothing. When
**  it  is called, src points to  the start of the data  area of one bag, and
**  dst to another. The function should copy the  data from the source bag to
**  the destination, making any appropriate changes.
**
**  Those functions are applied during  the garbage collection to each marked
**  bag, i.e., bags that are assumed  to be still live  to move them to their
**  new  position. The  intended  use is  for  weak  pointer bags, which must
**  remove references to identifiers of  any half-dead objects.
**
**  If no function  is installed for a TNum,  then the data is  simply copied
**  unchanged and this is done particularly quickly.
