**  'NrAllBags'
**
**  'NrAllBags' is the number of bags allocated since Gasman was initialized.
**  It is incremented for each 'NewBag' call.
**
**  'NrLiveBags'
**
**  'NrLiveBags' is the number of bags that were  live after the last garbage
**  collection.  So after a full  garbage collection it is simply  the number
**  of bags that have been found to be still live by this garbage collection.
**  After a partial garbage collection it is the sum of the previous value of
**  'NrLiveBags', which is the number  of live old  bags, and  the number  of
**  bags that  have been found to  be still live  by this garbage collection,
**  which is  the number of live   young  bags.   This  value  is used in the
**  information messages,  and to find  out  how  many  free  identifiers are
**  available.
**
**  'SizeLiveBags'
**
**  'SizeLiveBags' is  the total size of bags  that were  live after the last
**  garbage collection.  So after a full garbage  collection it is simply the
**  total size of bags that have been found to  be still live by this garbage
**  collection.  After  a partial  garbage  collection it  is the sum  of the
**  previous value of  'SizeLiveBags', which is the total   size of live  old
**  bags, and the total size of bags that have been found to be still live by
**  this garbage  collection,  which is  the  total size of  live young bags.
**  This value is used in the information messages.
**
**  'NrDeadBags'
**
**  'NrDeadBags' is  the number of bags that died since the last full garbage
**  collection.   So after a  full garbage  collection this is zero.  After a
**  partial  garbage  collection it  is  the  sum  of the  previous value  of
**  'NrDeadBags' and the  number of bags that  have been found to be dead  by
**  this garbage collection.  This value is used in the information messages.
**
**  'SizeDeadBags'
**
**  'SizeDeadBags' is  the total size  of bags that  died since the last full
**  garbage collection.  So  after a full   garbage collection this  is zero.
**  After a partial garbage collection it is the sum of the previous value of
**  'SizeDeadBags' and the total size of bags that have been found to be dead
**  by  this garbage  collection.   This  value  is used  in the  information
**  message.
**
**  'NrHalfDeadBags'
**
**  'NrHalfDeadBags'  is  the number of  bags  that  have  been  found to  be
**  reachable only by way of weak pointers since the last garbage collection.
**  The bodies of these bags are deleted, but their identifiers are marked so
**  that weak pointer objects can recognize this situation.

**  function for bags of type <type>.
**
**  A sweeping function is a function that takes two arguments src and dst of
**  type Bag *, and  a third, length of type  UInt, and returns nothing. When
**  it  is called, src points to  the start of the data  area of one bag, and
**  dst to another. The function should copy the  data from the source bag to
**  the destination, making any appropriate changes.
**
**  Those functions are applied during  the garbage collection to each marked
**  bag, i.e., bags that are assumed  to be still live  to move them to their
**  new  position. The  intended  use is  for  weak  pointer bags, which must
**  remove references to identifiers of  any half-dead objects.
**
**  If no function  is installed for a TNum,  then the data is  simply copied
**  unchanged and this is done particularly quickly.
