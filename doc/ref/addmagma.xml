<Chapter Label="Additive Magmas">
<Heading>Additive Magmas</Heading>

This chapter deals with domains that are closed under addition <C>+</C>,
which are called <E>near-additive magmas</E> in &GAP;.
Together with the domains closed under multiplication <C>*</C>
(see&nbsp;<Ref Chap="Magmas"/>),
they are the basic algebraic structures.
In many cases, the addition is commutative
(see&nbsp;<Ref Func="IsAdditivelyCommutative"/>),
the domain is called an <E>additive magma</E> then.
Every module (see&nbsp;<Ref Chap="Modules"/>),
vector space (see&nbsp;<Ref Chap="Vector Spaces"/>),
ring (see&nbsp;<Ref Chap="Rings"/>),
or field (see&nbsp;<Ref Chap="Fields and Division Rings"/>)
is an additive magma.
In the cases of all <E>(near-)additive magma-with-zero</E> or
<E>(near-)additive magma-with-inverses</E>,
additional additive structure is present
(see&nbsp;<Ref Sect="(Near-)Additive Magma Categories"/>).

This section describes
functions that create additive magmas from generators

the underlying operations for which methods can be installed
(see <Ref Func="NearAdditiveMagmaByGenerators"/>,

and functions for forming additive submagmas
(see <Ref Func="SubnearAdditiveMagma"/>,
