<Heading>Strings As Lists</Heading>

Note that a string is just a special case of a list.
So everything that is possible for lists (see&nbsp;<Ref Chap="Lists"/>)
is also possible for strings.
Thus you can access the characters in such a string
(see&nbsp;<Ref Sect="List Elements"/>),
test for membership (see&nbsp;<Ref Sect="Membership Test for Collections"/>),
ask for the length, concatenate strings
(see&nbsp;<Ref Func="Concatenation" Label="for several lists"/>),
form substrings etc.
You can even assign to a mutable string
(see&nbsp;<Ref Sect="List Assignment"/>).
Of course unless you assign a character in such a way that the list stays
dense,
the resulting list will no longer be a string.
<P/>
<Example><![CDATA[
gap> Length( s2 );
12
gap> s2[2];
'e'
gap> 'a' in s2;
false
gap> s2[2] := 'a';;  s2;
"Hallo world."
gap> s1{ [1..4] };
"Hell"
gap> Concatenation( s1{ [ 1 .. 6 ] }, s1{ [ 1 .. 4 ] } );
"Hello Hell"

<Heading>Printing Strings</Heading>
<Meth Name="ViewObj" Arg="str" Label="for a string"/>
<Meth Name="PrintObj" Arg="str" Label="for a string"/>

<Description>
If a string is displayed by <Ref Func="View"/>,
for example as result of an evaluation (see&nbsp;<Ref Sect="Main Loop"/>),
or by <Ref Func="ViewObj"/> and <Ref Func="PrintObj"/>,
it is displayed with enclosing doublequotes.
(But note that there is an ambiguity for the empty string which is also an
empty list of arbitrary &GAP; objects;
it is only printed like a string if it was input as empty string or converted
to a string with <Ref Func="ConvertToStringRep"/>.)
<!--  no longer true since we consider UTF-8 standard, but support latinX
The difference between <Ref Func="ViewObj" Label="for a string"/> and
<Ref Func="PrintObj" Label="for a string"/> is that the latter prints
<E>all</E> non-printable and non-ASCII characters in three digit octal
notation, while  <Ref Func="ViewObj" Label="for a string"/> sends all
printable characters to the output stream.
-->
The output of <Ref Func="PrintObj" Label="for a string"/> can be read back
into &GAP;.
<P/>
Strings behave differently from other &GAP; objects with respect to
<Ref Func="Print"/>, <Ref Func="PrintTo"/>, or <Ref Func="AppendTo"/>.
These commands <E>interpret</E> a string in the sense that they essentially
send the characters of the string directly to the output stream/file.
(But depending on  the type of the stream and the presence of some special
characters used as hints for line breaks there may be sent some additional
newline (or backslash and newline) characters.
<!-- % XXX Should the characters \< and \> and their use with <C>Print</C> be documented? -->
<P/>
<Example><![CDATA[
gap> s4:= "abc\"def\nghi";;
gap> View( s4 );  Print( "\n" );
"abc\"def\nghi"
gap> ViewObj( s4 );  Print( "\n" );
"abc\"def\nghi"
gap> PrintObj( s4 );  Print( "\n" );
"abc\"def\nghi"
gap> Print( s4 );  Print( "\n" );
abc"def
ghi
gap> s := "German uses strange characters: äöüß\n";
"German uses strange characters: äöüß\n"
gap> Print(s);
German uses strange characters: äöüß
gap> PrintObj(s);  Print( "\n" );
"German uses strange characters: \303\244\303\266\303\274\303\237\n"
]]></Example>
<P/>
<Log><![CDATA[
gap> s := "\007";
"\007"
gap> Print(s); # rings bell in many terminals
]]></Log>
<P/>
Note that only those line breaks are printed by <Ref Func="Print"/> that are
contained in the string
(<C>\n</C> characters, see&nbsp;<Ref Sect="Special Characters"/>),
as is shown in the example below.
<P/>
<Log><![CDATA[
gap> s1;

<Index>escaped characters</Index>
<Index>special character sequences</Index>

There are a number of <E>special character sequences</E> that can be used
between the singlequotes of a character literal or between the
doublequotes of a string literal to specify characters. 
They consist of a backslash <C>\</C> followed by a second character
indicating the type of special character sequence, and possibly more characters.
The following special character sequences are currently defined.
For any other sequence starting with a backslash, the backslash is ignored.
<P/>
<List>
<Mark><C>\n</C></Mark>
<Item>
    <E>newline character</E>.
    This is the character that, at least on UNIX systems,
    separates lines in a text file.
    Printing of this character in a string has the effect of moving
    the cursor down one line and back to the beginning of the line.
</Item>
<Mark>
<Index><C>\"</C></Index>
<Index>doublequote character</Index>
<C>\"</C></Mark>
<Item>
    <E>doublequote character</E>.
    Inside a string a doublequote must be escaped by the backslash,
    because it is otherwise interpreted as end of the string.
</Item>
<Mark>
<Index><C>\'</C></Index>
<Index>singlequote character</Index>
<C>\'</C></Mark>
<Item>
    <E>singlequote character</E>.
    Inside a character a singlequote must escaped by the backslash,
    because it is otherwise interpreted as end of the character.
</Item>
<Mark>
<Index><C>\\</C></Index>
<Index>backslash character</Index>
<C>\\</C></Mark>
<Item>
    <E>backslash character</E>.
    Inside a string a backslash must be escaped by another backslash,
    because it is otherwise interpreted as first character of
    an escape sequence.
</Item>
<Mark>
<Index><C>\b</C></Index>
<Index>backspace character</Index>
<C>\b</C></Mark>
<Item>
    <E>backspace character</E>.
    Printing this character should have the effect of moving the cursor
    back one character.  Whether it works or not is system dependent
    and should not be relied upon.
</Item>
<Mark>
<Index><C>\r</C></Index>
<Index>carriage return character</Index>
<C>\r</C></Mark>
<Item>
    <E>carriage return character</E>.
    Printing this character should have the effect of moving the cursor
    back to the beginning of the same line.  Whether this works or not
    is again system dependent.
</Item>
<Mark>
<Index><C>\c</C></Index>
<Index>flush character</Index>
<C>\c</C></Mark>
<Item>
    <E>flush character</E>.
    This character is not printed.
    Its purpose is to flush the output queue.
    Usually &GAP; waits until it sees a <C>newline</C> before it prints a
    string.
    If you want to display a string that does not include this character
    use <C>\c</C>.
</Item>
<Mark>
<Index><C>\XYZ</C></Index>
<Index>octal character codes</Index>
<C>\XYZ</C></Mark>
<Item>
    with <C>X</C>, <C>Y</C>, <C>Z</C> three octal digits, that is one
    of <C>"01234567"</C>.
    This is translated to the character corresponding to the number
    <C>X * 64 + Y * 8 + Z modulo 256</C>.
    This can be used to specify and store arbitrary binary data as a string
    in &GAP;.
</Item>
<Mark>
<Index><C>\0xYZ</C></Index>
<Index>hexadecimal character codes</Index>
<C>\0xYZ</C></Mark>
<Item>
    with <C>Y</C>, and <C>Z</C> hexadecimal digits, that is one of
    <C>"0123456789ABCDEFabcdef"</C>, where <C>a</C> to <C>f</C> and
    <C>A</C> to <C>F</C> are interpreted as the numbers <C>10</C> to
    <C>15</C>. This is translated to the character corresponding
    to the number <C>Y*16 + Z</C>.
</Item>
<Mark>
<Index>escaping non-special characters</Index>
other</Mark>
<Item>
  For any other character the backslash is ignored.
  <!--If the character is a letter, that is one of <C>a..zA..Z</C>, then a
      warning is displayed.-->
</Item>
</List>
<P/>
Again, if the line is displayed as result of an evaluation,
those escape sequences are displayed in the same way that they are input. 
<P/>
Only  <Ref Func="Print"/>, <Ref Func="PrintTo"/>, or <Ref Func="AppendTo"/>
send the characters directly to the output stream.
<P/>
<Example><![CDATA[
gap> "This is one line.\nThis is another line.\n";
"This is one line.\nThis is another line.\n"
gap> Print( last );
This is one line.
This is another line.
]]></Example>
<P/>
Note in particular that it is not  allowed to enclose a <A>newline</A> inside
the string.
You can use the  special character sequence <C>\n</C> to write strings that
include <A>newline</A> characters.
If, however, an input string is too long to fit on a single line it is
possible to <E>continue</E> it over several lines.
In this case the last character of each input line, except the last line must
be a backslash.
Both backslash and <A>newline</A> are thrown away by &GAP; while reading the
string.
Note that the same continuation mechanism is available for identifiers and
integers, see&nbsp;<Ref Sect="Special Rules for Input Lines"/>.

The rules on escaping are ignored in a triple quoted string, see <Ref
Sect="Triple Quoted String"/>

</Section>

<Section Label="Triple Quoted String">
<Heading>Triple Quoted Strings</Heading>


Another method of entering strings in GAP is triple quoted strings.
Triple quoted strings ignore the rules on escaping given in <Ref
Sect="Special Characters"/>. Triple quoted strings begin an end with
three doublequotes. Inside the triple quotes no escaping is done,
and the string continues, including newlines, until three doublequotes
are found.
<P/>
<Example><![CDATA[
gap> """Print("\n")""";
"Print(\"\\n\")"
]]></Example>

Triple quoted strings are represented internally identically to all other
strings, they only provide an alternative method of giving strings to GAP.

Triple quoted strings still follow GAP's line editing rules 
(<Ref Sect="Special Rules for Input Lines"/>), which state that in normal
line editing mode, lines starting <C>gap> </C>, <C>> </C> or <C>brk> </C> will
have this beginning part removed.

<Index Subkey="for GAP objects">LaTeX</Index>

For the purpose of generating &LaTeX; source code with &GAP; it is 
recommended to add new functions which will print the &LaTeX; source 
or return &LaTeX; strings for further processing.
<P/>

An alternative approach could be based on methods for the default &LaTeX; 
representation for each appropriate type of objects. However, there is
no clear notion of a default &LaTeX; code for any non-trivial mathematical
object; moreover, different output may be required in different contexts.
<P/>

While customisation of such an operation may require changes in a variety 
of methods that may be distributed all over the library, the user will 
have a clean overview of the whole process of &LaTeX; code generation if 
it is contained in a single function. Furthermore, there may be kinds of 
objects which are not detected by the method selection, or there may be 
a need in additional parameters specifying requirements for the output.
<P/>

This is why having a special purpose function for each particular case 
is more suitable. &GAP; provides several functions that produce &LaTeX; 
strings for those situations where this is nontrivial and reasonable. 
A useful example is <Ref Func="LaTeXStringDecompositionMatrix"/> from
the &GAP; library, others can be found entering <C>?LaTeX</C> at the 
&GAP; prompt. Package authors are encouraged to add an index entry 
<C>LaTeX</C> to the documentation of all &LaTeX; string producing functions.
This way, entering <C>?LaTeX</C> will give an overview of all documented 
functionality in this direction.
