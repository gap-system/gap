This chapter describes an interface to vector and matrix objects
which are not represented by plain lists (of plain lists),
cf. Chapters <Ref Chap="Row Vectors"/> and <Ref Chap="Matrices"/>.

Currently the following categories of vector and matrix objects
are supported in &GAP;.
More can be added as soon as there is need for them.

<Section Label="Operations for Row List Matrix Objects">
<Heading>Operations for Row List Matrix Objects</Heading>

In general, matrix objects are not lists in the sense of <Ref Filt="IsList"/>,
and they need not behave like lists,
that is, they need not obey all the rules for lists that are stated in
Chapter <Ref Chap="Lists"/>.
There are situations where one wants to have matrix objects
that can on the one hand benefit from &GAP;'s method selection,
as is explained in
Section <Ref Sect="Concepts and Rules for Vector and Matrix Objects"/>,
and do on the other hands support access to &GAP; objects that represent
their rows (which are suitable vector objects),
such that the operations described in this section are supported
for these matrix objects.

<P/>

One implementation of such matrices is given by the
<Ref Attr="ConstructingFilter" Label="for a matrix object"/> value
<Ref Filt="IsPlistMatrixRep"/>,
and any row of these matrices is a vector object in
<Ref Filt="IsPlistVectorRep"/>.
Note that these objects do <E>not</E> lie in <Ref Filt="IsList"/>
(and in particular not in <Ref Filt="IsPlistRep"/>),
thus we are allowed to define the above operations only restrictively,
as follows.

<P/>

Unbinding an entry in a row or unbinding a row in a matrix is allowed only
in the last position,
that is, the vector and matrix objects insist on being dense.
All rows of a matrix must have the same length and the same base domain.

<Section Label="Operations for Vector and Matrix Objects, without Defaults">
<Heading>Operations for Vector and Matrix Objects, without Defaults</Heading>

Here we list those operations for vector and matrix objects
for which no default methods can be installed.
When one implements a new type of vector or matrix objects
then one has to install specific methods at least for these operations,
in order to make the objects behave as described in this chapter.
(Of course, it is advisable to install specific methods also for other
operations, for performance reasons.
The installations of default methods can be found in the file
<F>lib/matobj.gi</F> of the &GAP; distribution,
just check for which operations it makes sense to overload them
for your new type of vector or matrix objects.)
