<Chapter Label="Permutations">
<Heading>Permutations</Heading>

&GAP; offers a data type <E>permutation</E> to describe the elements
of permutation groups.
<P/>
The points on which permutations in &GAP; act are the positive
integers up to a certain architecture dependent limit,
and the image of a point <M>i</M> under a permutation <M>p</M> is written
<M>i^p</M>, which is expressed as <M>i</M><C>^</C><M>p</M> in &GAP;.
(This action is also implemented by the function <Ref Func="OnPoints"/>.)
If <M>i</M><C>^</C><M>p</M> is different from <M>i</M>,
we say that <M>i</M> is <E>moved</E> by&nbsp;<M>p</M>,
otherwise it is <E>fixed</E>.
Permutations in &GAP; are  entered and displayed in cycle notation,
such as <C>(1,2,3)(4,5)</C>.
<P/>
The preimage of the point <M>i</M> under the permutation <M>p</M> can be
computed as <M>i</M><C>/</C><M>p</M>,
without constructing the inverse of <M>p</M>.
<P/>
For arithmetic operations for permutations and their precedence,
see&nbsp;<Ref Sect="Arithmetic Operations for Elements"/>.
<P/>
In the names of the &GAP; functions that deal with permutations,
the word <Q>Permutation</Q> is usually abbreviated to <Q>Perm</Q>,
to save typing.
For example,
the category test function for permutations is <Ref Func="IsPerm"/>.

<Description>
<Index Subkey="for permutations">equality test</Index>
<Index Subkey="for permutations">precedence test</Index>
Two permutations are equal if they move the same points and all these points
have the same images under both permutations.
<P/>
The permutation <A>p1</A> is smaller than <A>p2</A>
if <A>p1</A> <M>\neq</M> <A>p2</A>
and <M>i^{{<A>p1</A>}} &lt; i^{{<A>p2</A>}}</M>,
where <M>i</M> is the smallest point with
<M>i^{{<A>p1</A>}} \neq i^{{<A>p2</A>}}</M>.
Therefore the identity permutation is the smallest permutation,
see also Section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="Comparison Operations for Elements"/>.
<P/>
Permutations can be compared with certain other &GAP; objects,
see&nbsp;<Ref Sect="Comparisons"/> for the details.
