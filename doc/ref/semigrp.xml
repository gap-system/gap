<Section Label="Ideals of semigroups">
<Heading>Ideals of semigroups</Heading>

Ideals of semigroups are the same as ideals of the semigroup when 
considered as a magma.
For documentation on ideals for magmas, see <Ref Func="Magma"/>.

<Section Label="Congruences for semigroups">
<Heading>Congruences for semigroups</Heading>

An equivalence or a congruence on a semigroup is the
equivalence or congruence on the semigroup considered as a magma.
So, to deal with equivalences and congruences on semigroups,
magma functions are used.
For documentation on equivalences and congruences for magmas,
see <Ref Func="Magma"/>.

<Section Label="Quotients">
<Heading>Quotients</Heading>

Given a semigroup and a congruence on the semigroup, one
can construct a new semigroup: the quotient semigroup.
The following functions deal with quotient semigroups in &GAP;.
