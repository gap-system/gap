This helps us to keep track of the number of &GAP; users.
<P/>
If you publish a mathematical result that was partly obtained using
&GAP;, please cite &GAP;, just as you would cite another paper that you
used (see below for sample citation). Also we would appreciate if you

modifications will not be allowed. We want all versions of &GAP; to
remain free.
<P/>
If you  modify any part of &GAP; and redistribute it,  you must supply a
<F>README</F> document. This should specify what modifications you made in

<P/>
Of course we are interested in all of your modifications. In particular
we would like to see bug-fixes, improvements and new functions. So again
we would appreciate it if you would inform us about all modifications you

In addition to the general copyright for &GAP; set forth above,

<P/>
The <Package>Cygwin</Package> API library is also covered by the GNU GPL. 
The executable we provide is linked against this library (and in the process 
includes GPL'd <Package>Cygwin</Package> glue code). This means that the 
executable falls under the GPL too, which it does anyhow.
