<Index>equivalence relation</Index>
An <E>equivalence relation</E> <A>E</A> over the set <A>X</A> is a relation
on <A>X</A> which is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. 
A <E>partition</E> <A>P</A> is a set of subsets of <A>X</A> such that
for all <M>R, S \in P</M>, <M>R \cap S</M> is the empty set and
<M>\cup P = X</M>.  
An equivalence relation induces a partition such that if <M>(x,y) \in E</M>
then <M>x, y</M> are in the same element of <A>P</A>.
<P/>
Like all binary relations in &GAP; equivalence 
relations are regarded as general endomorphic mappings (and the operations,
properties and attributes of general mappings are available). 
However, partitions provide an efficient way of representing equivalence 
relations.  Moreover, only the non-singleton classes
or blocks are listed allowing for small equivalence relations to be
represented on infinite sets. Hence the main attribute of equivalence 
relations is <Ref Attr="EquivalenceRelationPartition"/>
which provides the partition induced by the given equivalence.
