Usually a family of associative words will be generated by constructing
the free object generated by them.
See <Ref Func="FreeMonoid" Label="for given rank"/>,
<Ref Func="FreeSemigroup" Label="for given rank"/> for details.

<Section Label="Representations for Associative Words">
<Heading>Representations for Associative Words</Heading>

&GAP; provides two different internal kinds of representations of
associative words.  The first one are <Q>syllable representations</Q> in which
words are stored in syllable (i.e. generator,exponent) form. (Older versions
of &GAP; only used this representation.) The second kind are <Q>letter
representations</Q> in which each letter in a word is represented by its index
number. Negative numbers are used for inverses. Unless the syllable
representation is specified explicitly when creating the free group/monoid
or semigroup, a letter representation is used by default.
<P/>
Depending on the task in mind, either of these two representations will
perform better in time or in memory use and algorithms that are syllable or
letter based (for example <Ref Oper="GeneratorSyllable"/> and
<Ref Oper="Subword"/>) perform substantially better in the corresponding
representation.
For example when creating pc groups (see&nbsp;<Ref Chap="Pc Groups"/>),
it is advantageous to use a syllable representation while calculations in
free groups usually benefit from using a letter representation.
