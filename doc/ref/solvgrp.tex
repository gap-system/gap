\Section{Polycyclic generating systems}

A generating sequence  $(g_1,\ldots,g_n)$ for  a  group <G> is  called  a
_polycyclic generating system_ (or _pcgs_) if the  series of subgroups $G
= G_0 > G_1 > \ldots > G_n = \{1\}$ with $G_i  = \< g_{i+1}, \ldots,
g_n  >$   is a  subnormal    series for  <G>  with  cyclic  factors
$G_i/G_{i+1}$ of prime order.  Such a pcgs  exists for finite <G> if  and
only if <G> is solvable.

\>Pcgs( <G> )

This function constructs and returns  a pcgs for the group  <G> if it  is
solvable and returns `false' otherwise. The default function converts <G>
into  an  ag group  and returns the   image  of the polycyclic generating
system of   that ag  group under  the  isomorphism between  the  ag group
and~<G>.

\>ExponentsOfPcElement( <pcgs>, <g> )
\>DepthOfPcElement( <pcgs>, <g> )
\>LeadingExponentOfPcElement( <pcgs>, <g> )

These functions ``factorize'' a given  element <g> of `<pcgs>.group' into
the  generators  in  the  list $(g_1,\ldots,g_n)$. `ExponentsOfPcElement'
returns a list <e> such that
$$ g = g_1^{e[1]} \cdot g_2^{e[2]} \cdot \ldots \cdot g_n^{e[n]}. $$

The  default   method  for `ExponentsOfPcElement'  performs   a  division
algorithm, i.e., it determines $e[1]$ such that $g_1^{-e[1]}g \in \<
g_2, \ldots, g_n >$, by increasing $e[1]$ until the membership test
yields true. Then  <g>  is replaced   by $g_1^{-e[1]}g$ and  the step  is
repeated for $e[2]$ and so on.

The  functions      `DepthOfPcElement'   and `LeadingExponentOfPcElement'
determine  the depth  and the  leading  exponent (as  an  integer)  of an
element  w.r.t.~to a  pcgs.   Both functions can   be  viewed  as special
versions of the function `ExponentsOfPcElement'.

\>RelativeOrderOfPcElement( <pcgs>, <g> )

Given  an element <g> with  `DepthPcElement(  <pcgs>, <g>  ) = <d>', this
function determines the order of the coset $G_{d-1}g$ in the factor group
$G_{d-1}/G_d$.

The default  function performs a division step  like the one described in
`ExponentsOfPcElement' above.

\>ElementaryAbelianSeries( <G> )

The default  function converts   <G> into an   isomorphic pc   group  and
computes the elementary abelian series in this group.

\Section{Affine methods!for solvable groups}

Let <U> and <H> be subgroups of a group <G>  such that <H> normalizes <U>
and consider the   action of <H> on  <U>  by conjugation. If   <U> has an
elementary abelian subgroup <N> (i.e., a vector space)  that is normal in
both  <U> and   <H>, then  affine   methods  can  be employed to   deduce
information   about   <H>-conjugacy    in  <U>  from   information  about
<H>-conjugacy in $U/N$.  In particular, one  can define a set $R_H(U)$ of
_canonical <H>-class    representatives_   for <U>  such  that,  given  a
representative  $hN\in  R_H(U/N)$ in  the  factor group, the intersection
$R_H(U) \cap hN$ (i.e., the set  of canonical representatives in <U> that
map  to <hN>  in  $U/N$) is of   the form <hK>   with <K> a set of  orbit
representatives of the affine action on the vector space <N> given by
$$ C \to {\rm AGL}(N), \qquad c \mapsto ( n \mapsto [h,c] n^c ), $$
where <C> is the preimage  of $C_{H/N}(hN)$ in  <H>. The centralizer of a
representative  $hk  \in  hK$  can also  be   calculated  as described in
\cite{MeckyNeubuser89}.

\>Centralizer( <G>, <U> | <u> )!{for solvable groups}

The centralizer of a  group or an element   is calculated by  the methods
mentioned  above. If only one argument  <U> is given,  the centralizer of
<U> in its parent group is calculated.

\>ConjugacyClasses( [ <H>, ] <U> )!{for solvable groups}

The <H>-conjugacy classes of <U> are calculated by affine methods. If the
first argument <H> is not given, the <U>-classes of <U> are calculated.

\>ExternalSet( <G>, <D>, \[, {Pcgs( <G> )}, <oprs> \] \[, <opr> \] )!{for
solvable groups}
\){{\it and the other operation functions analogously}}

For a solvable group <G>, the  operation functions use special algorithms
which make use of  a pcgs for  <G>. To activate  these methods, you  must
supply an external set constructed
\medskip
\item
  either via <gens>    and <oprs>, where `<gens>   =  Pcgs( <G>  )'  (for
  example, as `ExternalSet( <G>, <D>, Pcgs( <G> ), <oprs>, <opr> )'), or
\item
  or without   <gens> and  <oprs>, where   `IsPcgsComputable(  <G> )'  is
  `true', e.g. if <G> already has a pcgs.

\>Enumerator( <xset> )!{for external orbits!for solvable groups}
\>Stabilizer( <G>, <D>, <p> \[, {Pcgs( <G> )}, <oprs> \] \[, <opr> \]
)!{for solvable groups}
\>StabilizerOfExternalSet( <xset> )!{for solvable groups}
\>OrbitStabilizer( <G>, \[ <D>, \] <pnt> \[, {Pcgs( <G> )}, <oprs> \] \[,
<opr> \] )!{for solvable groups}
\>CanonicalRepresentativeOfExternalSet( <xset> )!{for solvable groups}
\>OperatorOfExternalSet( <xset> )!{for solvable groups}

\danger    Since every group permutes   the  orbits of  a normal subgroup
setwise, and since  a solvable group <G> has  a composition series $<G> =
G_0 > \ldots  > G_n=\{1\}$ with cyclic  factors, the <G>-orbit of a point
<pnt> can  be  constructed by iterated  cyclic   extension. The  orbit $p
G_{i-1}$ is   either  equal  to the   orbit   $<p>  G_i$  or it    is the
concatenation  the pairwise   disjoint  mapped orbits   $<p>  G_ig^j$ for
$j=0,\ldots, [G_{i-1}:G_i] - 1$ if  $\langle G_i, g\rangle = G_{i-1}$. In
particular, the orbit of <p> under a  member of the composition series is
always a starting-piece of the entire <G>-orbit.

If the orbit is stable in a cyclic extension step,  i.e., if $p G_{i-1} =
p G_i$, there is an element $h\in G_i$ such that $p.gh^{-1} = p$ with <g>
as above. The  elements $gh^{-1}$ collected over  all steps  in which the
orbit is stable form a (reversed) pcgs for the stabilizer of <p>. In this
way the    stabilizer  can be   computed together    with   the orbit  in
`OrbitStabilizer'. In a similar manner one can construct, given any point
<p> of   the operation domain,  an   element in  <G> mapping <p>   to its
canonical representative.

\>RepresentativeOperation( <G>, <D>, <d>, <e> \[, {Pcgs( <G> )}, <oprs>
\] \[, <opr> \] )!{for solvable groups}

If <d> and <e> are in the same orbit of an operation <xset>, the external
orbits `$xorb_d$    := ExternalOrbit( <xset>,  <d>   )'  and `$xorb_e$ :=
ExternalOrbit(      <xset>,     <e>    )'     will     have    the   same
`CanonicalRepresentativeOfExternalSet',        and    hence             a
`RepresentativeOperation'  from   <d> to <e>   can be  calculated  as the
quotient `OperatorOfExternalSet(  $xorb_d$  )    * OperatorOfExternalSet(
$xorb_e$ ) ^ -1'.
