<Chapter Label="Files and Filenames">
<Heading>Files and Filenames</Heading>

Files are identified by filenames, which are represented in &GAP; as
strings.  Filenames can be created directly by the user or a program, but
of course this is operating system dependent.
<P/>
Filenames for some files can  be constructed in  a system independent way
using the following functions.  This is done by first getting a directory
object for the directory the file shall  reside in, and then constructing
the filename.  However, it is  sometimes necessary to construct filenames
of files in subdirectories relative to a given directory object.  In this
case the directory separator is <E>always</E> <C>/</C> even under DOS or
MacOS.
<P/>
Section <Ref Sect="Directories"/> describes how to construct directory objects
for the common &GAP; and system directories.
Using the command <Ref Func="Filename" Label="for a directory and a string"/>
it is possible to construct a filename pointing to a file in these
directories.
There are also functions to test for accessibility of files,
see&nbsp;<Ref Sect="File Access"/>.


<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->
<Section Label="Portability">
<Heading>Portability</Heading>

For portability filenames and directory  names should be restricted to at
most   8 alphanumerical characters  optionally followed  by a dot <C>.</C>
and between 1 and 3 alphanumerical characters.  Upper case letters should
be  avoided because some  operating systems  do  not make any distinction
between case,  so that <C>NaMe</C>, <C>Name</C>  and  <C>name</C> all  refer to the same
file  whereas  some   operating  systems are case   sensitive.   To avoid
problems only lower case characters should be used.
<P/>
Another function which is system-dependent is <Ref Func="LastSystemError"/>.

<ManSection>
<Func Name="LastSystemError" Arg=''/>

<Description>
<Ref Func="LastSystemError"/> returns a record describing the last system
error that has occurred.
This record  contains at least the component <C>message</C> which is a
string. This message is, however, highly operating system dependent and
should only be used as an informational message for the user.

<Heading>GAP Root Directories</Heading>
<Index Key="GAPInfo.RootPaths"><C>GAPInfo.RootPaths</C></Index>
<Index Key="GAPInfo.UserGapRoot"><C>GAPInfo.UserGapRoot</C></Index>

When &GAP; is started it determines a list of directories which we
call the <E>&GAP; root directories</E>. In a running &GAP; session  
this list can be found in <C>GAPInfo.RootPaths</C>.
<P/>
The core part of &GAP; knows which files to read relative to its root 
directories. For example when &GAP; wants to read its library file 
<F>lib/group.gd</F>, it appends this path to each path in 
<C>GAPInfo.RootPaths</C> until it finds the path of an existing file.
The first file found this way is read.
<P/>
Furthermore, &GAP; looks for available packages by examining the
subdirectories <F>pkg/</F> in each of the directories in 
<C>GAPInfo.RootPaths</C>.
<P/>
The root directories are specified via one or several of the 
<C>-l paths</C> command line options, see <Ref Sect="Command Line Options"/>.
Furthermore, by default &GAP; automatically prepends a user specific &GAP; root
directory to the list; this can be avoided by calling &GAP; with 
the <C>-r</C>  option. The name of this user specific directory depends
on your operating system, it can be found in <C>GAPInfo.UserGapRoot</C>.
This directory can be used to tell &GAP; about personal preferences,
to always load some additional code, to install additional packages,
or to overwrite some &GAP; files. See <Ref Sect="sect:gap.ini"/>
for more information how to do this.
<P/>

<!--
  FL: An example how to overwrite the library file lib/files.gd doesn't
      look useful for me. We should not encourage users to make use
      of this possibility. That it can be done in principle as described below
      is also clear from the shorter description above.

<Index Key=".gap directory"><F>.gap</F> directory</Index>


When starting &GAP; it is possible to specify various directories as
root directories.  In &GAP;'s view of the world these directories are
merged into one meta-directory.  This directory is called <E>&GAP; root
directory</E> in the following.
<P/>
For example, suppose that <C>root1;root2;...</C> is passed as argument
to <C>-l</C> when &GAP; is started and &GAP; wants to locate a file
<F>lib/group.gd</F> in the &GAP; root directory.
If the command line option <C>-r</C> is not given then &GAP; will first
check if the file exists in the <F>.gap</F> subdirectory of the user's
home directory. On Mac OS X, the directory <F>Library/Preferences/GAP</F>
in the user's home directory will be searched next.
If the command line option <C>-r</C> is given or if the file does not
exist inside <F>.gap</F> (or <F>Library/Preferences/GAP</F>) 
then the directory <C>root1</C> is checked next,
and if the file is not found there, <C>root2</C> is checked, and so on.
<P/>
This layout makes it possible to have one system-wide installation of &GAP;
which is read-only but still allows users to modify individual files.
Therefore instead of constructing an absolute path name to a file
you should always use <Ref Func="DirectoriesLibrary"/> or
<Ref Func="DirectoriesPackageLibrary"/> together with
<Ref Func="Filename" Label="for a directory and a string"/>
to construct a filename for a file in the &GAP; root directory.
<P/>
<E>For example</E>,
suppose that the system-wide installation lives in <F>/usr/local/lib/gap4</F>
and you want to modify the file <F>lib/files.gd</F> without disturbing the
system installation.
<P/>
The simplest way to achieve this is to create a directory <F>.gap</F>
in your home directory, and a subdirectory <F>lib</F> which contains
the modified <F>lib/files.gd</F>.
Afterwards, when you start &GAP; then the modified file is read
instead of <F>/usr/local/lib/gap4/lib/files.gd</F>,
except if the <C>-r</C> command line option
(see <Ref Sect="Command Line Options"/>) is given.
<P/>
As an alternative to the <F>.gap</F> directory,
you can also use another directory which then must be mentioned in the
directories that are passed as argument to <C>-l</C>.
This variant can be useful if the changed files shall be used by several
users.
For example, you may create a new directory <F>/home/myhome/gap</F>
containing a subdirectory <F>lib</F> which contains the modified
<F>lib/files.gd</F>.
<P/>
The directory/file structure now looks like
<P/>
<Log><![CDATA[
/usr/local/lib/gap4/
/usr/local/lib/gap4/lib/
/usr/local/lib/gap4/lib/files.gd
/home/myhome/gap/
/home/myhome/gap/lib
/home/myhome/gap/lib/files.gd
]]></Log>
<P/>

If you start &GAP; using (under UNIX)
<P/>
<Log><![CDATA[
you@unix> gap -l '/home/myhome/gap;/usr/local/lib/gap4'
]]></Log>
<P/>
then the file <F>/home/myhome/gap/lib/files.gd</F> will be used whenever
&GAP; references the file with filename <F>lib/files.gd</F> relative to
the &GAP; root directory.
<P/>
This setup also allows one to easily install new &GAP; packages or bugfixes
even if no write access to the system &GAP; installation is possible.
Simply unpack the files into your <F>.gap</F> directory
or into <F>/home/myhome/gap</F>, respectively.

<Heading>Special Filenames</Heading>

The special filename <C>"*stdin*"</C> denotes the standard input, i.e.,
the stream through which the user enters commands to &GAP;.
The exact behaviour of reading from <C>"*stdin*"</C> is operating system
dependent, but usually the following happens.
If &GAP; was started with no input redirection,
statements are read from the terminal stream until the user enters the
end of file character, which is usually <B>Ctrl-D</B>.
Note that terminal streams are special, in that they may yield ordinary input
<E>after</E> an end of file.
Thus when control returns to the main read-eval-print loop the user can
continue with &GAP;.
If &GAP; was started with an input redirection, statements are read from the
current position in the input file up to the end of the file.
When control returns to the main read eval view loop the input stream will
still return end of file, and &GAP; will terminate.
<P/>
The  special filename <C>"*errin*"</C> denotes the stream connected to the
UNIX <C>stderr</C> output.
This stream is usually connected to the terminal, even if the standard input
was redirected, unless the standard error stream was also redirected,
in which case opening of <C>"*errin*"</C> fails.
<P/>
The special filename <C>"*stdout*"</C> can be used to print to the standard
output.
<P/>
The special filename <C>"*errout*"</C> can be used to print to the standard
error output file, which is usually connected to the terminal,
even if the standard output was redirected.

you can use <Ref Func="LastSystemError"/> to get more information about the
nature of the failure.

Note that this function does not check if the &GAP; process actually has
