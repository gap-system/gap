Information about &GAP; is best obtained from the &GAP; Web pages that
you find on:
<P/>
	<URL>http://www.gap-system.org</URL>
<P/>
and its mirror at:
<P/>
	<URL>http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~GAP</URL>
<P/>
There you will find, amongst other things
<List>
<Item>
 directions to the sites from which you can download the
current &GAP; distribution, any bug-fixes, all accepted &GAP; packages,
and a selection of other contributions.
</Item>
<Item>
 the &GAP; manual and an archive of the <C>gap-forum</C> mailing
list, formatted for reading with a Web browser, and indexed for
searching.
</Item>
<Item>
 information about &GAP; developers, and about the email
addresses available for comment, discussion and support.
</Item>
</List>
<P/>
<P/>
We would particularly ask you to note the following things:
<List>
<Item>
 The  &GAP; Forum &ndash; an email discussion forum for comments,
discussions or questions about &GAP;. You must subscribe to the list
before you can post to it, see the Web page for details.
In  particular we will announce bugfixes in this mailing list.
</Item>
<Item>
 The email address <Email>support@gap-system.org</Email> to which you
are asked to send any questions or bug reports which do not seem likely
to be of interest to the whole &GAP; Forum.
Section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="If Things Go Wrong" BookName="ref"/>
tells you what to include in a bug report.
</Item>
<Item>
 We also ask you to send a brief message to <Email>support@gap-system.org</Email> when you install &GAP;.
</Item>
<Item>
 The correct form of citation of &GAP;, which we ask you use
whenever you publish scientific results obtained using &GAP;.
</Item>
</List>
<P/>
It finally remains  for me to wish you  all pleasure and success in using
&GAP;, and to invite your constructive comment and criticism.
<P/>
