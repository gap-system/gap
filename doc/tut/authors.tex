The following list gives the authors (who designed the code in the first
place) as well as the current maintainers of the various modules of which
{\GAP} is composed.

Since the process of modularization was started only recently, there might
be omissions both in scope and in contributors.  The compilers of the
manual apologize for any such errors and promise to rectify them in future
editions.
