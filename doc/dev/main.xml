<Abstract>
In this <Emph>development manual</Emph> we collect documentation 
of various tasks needed for the further development, maintenance and
distribution of &GAP;.
<P/>
Some sections provide practical howto's and check lists for tasks like,
e.g.: commiting changes, testing, wrapping archives, compiling documentation.
<P/>
Other sections document certain conventions which are followed by the
active members of The &GAP; Group. Some examples: there are several
mailing lists which are used for different purposes; there is a mechanism
how larger changes to the &GAP; system should be announced and discussed
among the developers before they are commited, called <Emph>proposals</Emph>;
there is a concept of <Emph>modules</Emph> where  parts of the
&GAP; system are assigned to specified maintainers.
