<Heading>Debugging the &GAP; Kernel</Heading>

The &GAP; kernel supports a variety of options which can be enabled by running
<C>configure</C> which provide various checks which can be useful when writing
and debugging &GAP; kernel code.
<P/>

The first option, <C>--enable-debug</C>, is well supported and can be used
whenever the &GAP; kernel, or kernel modules, are being developed (although
developers should still check their code works without it).
<P/>
<C>--enable-debug</C> enables assertions throughout the kernel. These
assertions are implemented using the <C>GAP_ASSERT</C> macro. These
assertions are disabled when &GAP; is compiled without <C>--enable-debug</C>.
When <C>--enable-debug</C> is enabled, <C>KernelDebug</C> will be shown in
the line starting <C>Configuration:</C> when &GAP; is started.
<P/>

The next two options are more experimental, and are not designed to be constantly
enabled. They are particularly designed to track down bugs relating to memory
corruption relating to GASMAN (&GAP;'s memory manager). They cannot both be enabled
at the same time.

These options assume you are familiar somewhat familiar with the internals of GASMAN
(see gasman.c for more information). In particular, GASMAN represents memory using
an object of type Bag. The contents of these Bags can be moved during garbage collection.

<P/>
<C>--enable-memory-checking</C> makes &GAP; check for C pointers to the content of Bags
being used after a new Bag has been created or a Bag is resized. GASMAN
moves Bags during garbage collection, which can happen whenever a new Bag is created
or a Bag is resized. However, as it is very unlikely that any single allocation
will cause a garbage collection, these bugs trigger very rarely. Also the problems
caused by these bugs are, if the C pointer is written to, a random other Bag,
somewhere in &GAP;, is changed.
<P/>

After configuring, the memory checking must still be turned on. This can be done
either by passing <C>--enableMemCheck</C> to &GAP;'s command line, or calling <C>GASMAN_MEM_CHECK(1)</C>.
Note that enabling these tests makes &GAP; VERY, VERY slow. It can (depending on the
machine and operating system) take &GAP; over a day to start, and load all standard
packages. The recommending way to use this option is to start &GAP;, and then load
small test files to try to isolate the problem. <C>MemCheck</C> will be shown in
the line starting <C>Configuration:</C> when &GAP; is started.
<P/>

Known bugs: &GAP; will crash if <C>IO_fork</C> from the IO package is called while
memory checking is enabled.
<P/>

<C>--enable-valgrind</C> makes changes to GASMAN so it is compatible with the
<URL Text="valgrind">https://valgrind.org</URL> memory checking program.
Without this, Valgrind will report many incorrect warnings relating to GASMAN
and no useful warnings.
<P/>

At present, this <C>--enable-valgrind</C> only checks for invalid writes to the
last bag which was created. Also, this option does not do anything unless &GAP;
is run through Valgrind (for example by running <C>valgrind gap</C>.
