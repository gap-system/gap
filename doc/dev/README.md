# GAP Development manual

This is the GAP Development manual. It's not yet complete, 
and some of its parts require revision, so please read it
with caution. Contributions are welcomed!

To build this manual, call

```
gap makedocrelx.g 
````

in this directory. This will build HTML, PDF and text versions.

Please note that this manual is not a part of the GAP distribution,
so it will not be built by calling `make doc`.
