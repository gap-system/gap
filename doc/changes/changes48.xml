<Chapter Label="ChangesGAP47toGAP48"> 
<Heading>Changes between &GAP; 4.7 and &GAP; 4.8</Heading>

This chapter contains an overview of the most important changes
introduced in &GAP; 4.8.0 release (the beta release of &GAP; 4.8).
Later it will also contain information about subsequent update 
releases for &GAP; 4.8.

First of all, the &GAP; development repository is now hosted on GitHub at
<URL>https://github.com/gap-system/gap</URL>, and &GAP; 4.8 is the first 
major &GAP; release made from this repository. The public issue tracker
for the core &GAP; system is located at 
<URL>https://github.com/gap-system/gap/issues</URL>,
and you may use appropriate milestones from 
<URL>https://github.com/gap-system/gap/milestones</URL> to see all changes
that were introduced in corresponding &GAP; releases. An overview of the
most significant ones is provided below.

<Heading>Changes in the core &GAP; system introduced in &GAP; 4.8</Heading>

New features:
<List>
<Item>
Added support for profiling which tracks how much time in spent on each line
of &GAP; code. This can be used to show where code is spending a long time
and also check which lines of code are even executed. See the documentation
for <Ref Func="ProfileLineByLine" BookName="ref"/> and
<Ref Func="CoverageLineByLine" BookName="ref"/> for details on generating profiles,
and the <Package>Profiling</Package> package for transforming these profiles
into a human-readable form.
</Item>
<!-- https://github.com/gap-system/gap/pull/192 -->
<Item>Added support for accessing lists using multiple indices and
indexing into lists using indices other than positive small integers.
This allows library or packages to install methods supporting expressions 
like
<Log><![CDATA[
m[1,2];
m[1,2,3] := x;
IsBound(m["a","b",Z(7)]);
Unbind(m[1][2,3])
]]></Log>
</Item>
<Item>
<!-- https://github.com/gap-system/gap/pull/90 -->
Added support for partially variadic functions to allow function expressions
like
<Log><![CDATA[
function(a,b,c,arg) ... end;
]]></Log>
which would require at least three arguments and assign the first three
to <A>a</A>, <A>b</A> and <A>c</A> and then a list containing any remaining
ones to <A>arg</A>.
<P/>
This may break an existing code when <A>arg</A> is used as a name of the
argument which is not the only one.
</Item>
<Item>
&GAP; now displays the filename and line numbers of statements in backtraces
when entering the break loop.
</Item>
</List>

Improved and extended functionality:
<List>
<Item>
Method tracing shows the filename and line of function during tracing.
</Item>
<Item>
<Ref Func="TraceAllMethods" BookName="ref"/> allows tracing all methods in &GAP;.
</Item>
<Item>
<Ref Func="GModuleByMats" BookName="ref"/> and some related functions now
work for infinite fields, in particular in characteristic 0. However,
this only applies for functions that do not need the MeatAxe, as that is
still tied to finite fields.
</Item>
<Item>
The most common cases of <Ref Oper="AddDictionary" BookName="ref"/> 
on three arguments now bypass method selection, avoiding the cost 
of determining homogeneity for plain lists of mutable objects.
</Item>
<Item> 
<!-- https://github.com/gap-system/gap/issues/7 -->
Package authors may optionally specify the source code repository,
issue tracker and support email address for their package using new
components in the <File>PackageInfo.g</File> file, which will be used
to create hyperlinks from the package overview page (see 
<File>PackageInfo.g</File> from the Example package which you may use
as a template).
</Item>
</List>

Changed functionality:
<List>  
<Item>
As a preparation for the future migration to the multithreaded &GAP;&nbsp;5,
some language extensions from the <Package>HPC-GAP</Package> project were
backported to the &GAP; library to help to unify the codebase of both 
&GAP;&nbsp;4 and &GAP;&nbsp;5. The only change which is not backwards
compatible is that <C>atomic</C>, <C>readonly</C> and <C>readwrite</C> are
now keywords, and thus are no longer valid identifiers.
So if you have any variables or functions using that name,
you will have to change it in &GAP; 4.8.
</Item>
</List>

Fixed bugs:

<List>
<Item>
A combination of two bugs could lead to a segfault. First off,
<Ref Func="NullMat" BookName="ref"/> (and various other &GAP; functions),
when asked to produce matrix over a small field, called 
<Ref Func="ConvertToMatrixRep" BookName="ref"/>. After this, if the user
tried to change one of the entries to a value from a larger extension
field, this resulted in an error. (This is now fixed).
<P/>
Unfortunately, the C code catching this error had a bug and allowed
users to type <Q>return</Q> to continue while ignoring the conversion
error. This was a bad idea, as the C code would be in an inconsistent
state at this point, subsequently leading to a crash.
<P/>
This, too, has been fixed, by not allowing the user to ignore the error
by entering <Q>return</Q>.
</Item>
<Item>
<!-- https://github.com/gap-system/gap/pull/243/ -->
<Ref Oper="PowerMod" BookName="ref"/> produced wrong results for univariate 
Laurent polynomials when the two polynomial arguments are stored with the 
same non-zero shift.
</Item>

<Heading>New and updated packages since &GAP; 4.7.8</Heading>

<Index>Packages, new</Index>
At the time of the release of &GAP; 4.7.8 there were 119 packages 
redistributed with &GAP;. New packages that have been added to the 
redistribution since the release of &GAP; 4.7.8 are: 

<List>
<Item>
<Package>matgrp</Package> package by Alexander Hulpke, which provides
an interface to the solvable radical functionality for matrix groups,
building on constructive recognition.
</Item>
<Item>
<Package>profiling</Package> package by Christopher Jefferson for
transforming profiles produced by <Ref Func="ProfileLineByLine" BookName="ref"/>
and <Ref Func="CoverageLineByLine" BookName="ref"/> into a human-readable form.
</Item>
