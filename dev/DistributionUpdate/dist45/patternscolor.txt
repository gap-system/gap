# These are patterns to classify files in a checked out GAP root
# directory according to whether they are shipped with the main
# archive, with the tools archive or not at all.
# Lines starting with # are ignored, lines starting with - are
# patterns for files not to be shipped, lines starting with +
# are patterns files to be shipped with the main archive and
# lines starting with a T are patterns for files to be shipped
# with the tools archive. The first match decides about the class.
