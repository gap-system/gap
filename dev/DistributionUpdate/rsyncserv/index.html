&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<a href="CHANGES">Details</a>)
</p>
<p>
This is a <a href="http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de:8001/~Frank.Luebeck">private 
service</a> for installing 
<span class="pkg">GAP</span>&nbsp;4.4 
on Linux PCs with i686 or x86_64 compatible processors (Pentium, Athlon, 
Xeon, Opteron, ...). 
Any reports or suggestions are welcome.
</p>

<p>
The idea is to install <span class="pkg">GAP</span> on Linux by syncronizing 
via the internet with a reference installation. Some features are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>A compiled <span class="pkg">GAP</span> is already included in the
distribution. It is statically
linked to work independently of the operating system version. 
On 64-bit systems <span class="pkg">GAP</span> can be called as 32-bit or
as 64-bit application. See <a href="#32versus64">below</a> for further
remarks.
</li>
<li>All distributed packages are installed, this is the main point which
makes installation much easier compared to a  direct installation  from 
the sources.
</li>
<li>
Installation is by choosing a directory and two easy commands, as explained
below (ok, some packages need other external software, see below). 
</li>
<li>
Upgrades can be done by one simple command.
</li>
<li>
...
</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Get <span class="pkg">GAP</span> via this Service</h2>
<p>
(and not directly from the <a
href="http://www.gap-system.org/Download/index.html">
<span class="pkg">GAP</span> site</a>.)
</p>

<p>
You need: a machine with PC architecture (i686 or x86_64 compatible) 
running under 
<a href="http://www.linux.org">Linux</a>, a directory with about 650&nbsp;MB of
free space and the <code>rsync</code> program (if you don't have
<code>rsync</code>, there is certainly a package with this name in your
Linux distribution).
</p>

<p>
Then copy the start script by
</p>
<pre>   rsync --port=8731 -azv beteigeuze.math.rwth-aachen.de::gap4r4/gapsync/gapsync .
</pre>
<p>
Call this script:
</p>
<pre>   ./gapsync
</pre>
<p>
You are asked for two directories. The first is for the installation. 
Everything is copied into a subdirectory <code>gap4r4</code> of this directory
(the default is <code>/usr/local/lib</code>). The second directory should be
one in your standard path of executable programs. The following scripts are
put in that directory (the default is <code>/usr/local/bin</code>):
</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>gap</code></dt>
<dd>for calling <span class="pkg">GAP</span></dd>
<dt><code>gapL</code></dt>
<dd>for calling <span class="pkg">GAP</span>, loading a workspace and then
reading a users <code>~/.gaprc</code> file (if it exists) <br />
This is the recommended way to start <span class="pkg">GAP</span>, it
is much faster than calling <code>gap</code>.</dd>
<dt><code>gapsync</code></dt>
<dd>for updating this <span class="pkg">GAP</span> installation</dd>
<dt><code>xgap</code></dt>
<dd>using <span class="pkg">GAP</span> via an X11 interface with graphical
capabilities (this does no longer work on newer systems and it may be quite
difficult to fix this, sorry)</dd>
<dt><code>pargap</code></dt>
<dd>the variant of <span class="pkg">GAP</span> provided by the 
<span class="pkg">ParGAP</span> package, see the package documentation</dd>
<!-- does not work as done so far, needs a hack with path settings
<dt><code>gac</code></dt>
<dd>for calling the <span class="pkg">GAP</span> compiler</dd>
-->
<dt><code>gap64, gap64L, pargap64</code></dt>
<dd>(only on x86_64 based 64-bit architecture) the scripts above always call
the 32-bit version of <span class="pkg">GAP</span>, use these scripts to 
call the 64-bit version</dd>
<dt><code></code></dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>If some of these scripts exist already you will be asked if they can be
deleted. Move them away first if you want to keep them.
</p>
<p>After giving these two directories, answer <code>y</code> to the next
question to start the installation. Depending on your network connection
you can use <span class="pkg">GAP</span> after two to ... minutes (about
180&nbsp;MB must be transferred via the internet).
</p>

<h2>Updating</h2>

<p>You can update the installation by calling the script
</p>
<pre>   gapsync
</pre>
<p>which was installed during initialization and mentioned above. The
syncronization will usually take just a few seconds. A new workspace is 
created after each syncronization locally.</p>
<p>An update should not be made while a <span class="pkg">GAP</span>
job is running. If you have long running jobs do not use an automatic, say
nightly, update.</p>


<h2>A note on updating from a version before <span
class="pkg">GAP</span>&nbsp;4.4.10 (October 2007)</h2>

<p>There are two reasons to update the <code>gapsync</code> script itself:
</p> 
<ul>
<li>The old script may no longer work on some systems after a system upgrade 
(the reason is that the script uses some <code>bash</code> extensions of
the <code>/bin/sh</code> shell which is restricted to  strict POSIX 
behaviour on these newer systems).</li>
<li>You may want to use the 64-bit version of <span class="pkg">GAP</span>
which is supported by this distribution since version 4.4.10.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is easy to achieve, just follow the instructions for the first
installation above: Get the current script by <code>rsync --port=8731 -azv
beteigeuze.math.rwth-aachen.de::gap4r4/gapsync/gapsync .</code>, call this
script <code>./gapsync</code>, give the same two paths as in your original
installation, and when you are asked if the existing start scripts should be
deleted answer <code>y</code>. That's it, from then just call the newly
installed 
<code>gapsync</code> for further updates.
</p>




<h2>Customization</h2>
<p>
You can customize the <code>gap</code>, <code>gap64</code>, <code>gapL</code>,
<code>gap64L</code>,
<code>gapsync</code> scripts by editing the files in the
<code>local/bin</code> subdirectory of this <span class="pkg">GAP</span>
installation.
</p>
<p>
You can customize the workspace used in your installation by copying
<code>gapsync/CreateWorkspace.sh</code> to
<code>local/bin/CreateWorkspace</code> (for 32-bit version) or
<code>local/bin/CreateWorkspace64</code> (for 64-bit version)
and editing the latter.
For example, you may want another set of packages preloaded.
</p>
<p>Additional packages can be installed in the <code>local/pkg</code>
subdirectory.
</p>
<p>Whenever you have changed something in the installation call
<code>gapsync</code> which will produce an updated workspace.
</p>
<p>
If you change things outside the <code>local</code> subdirectory they are
deleted with the next call of <code>gapsync</code>. If you find errors in
this part, please report them.
</p>
<!--<p>You can get colored prompts and input texts by the command 
<code>ColorPrompt(true);</code>. In case you like this, put this command in
your <code>~/.gaprc</code> file.
(This functionality was formerly provided exclusively by this distribution;
it was moved into the <span class="pkg">GAP</span> library with version
4.4.5; please change former <code>ReadLib("colorprompt.g");</code> in your
<code>.gaprc</code> file to the command given above.)
</p>-->
<p>If you have the pager program <code>less</code> available, you probably 
want to put the lines</p>
<pre>
    PAGER := "less";
    PAGER_OPTIONS := ["-f", "-r", "-a", "-i", "-M", "-j2"];
</pre>
<p>
in your <code>~/.gaprc</code> file.
</p>
<p>Many people like to have the prompt, input and output in different
colors, add the following line to your <code>~/.gaprc</code> file to use
this:</p>
<pre>
    ColorPrompt(true);
</pre>

<h2>Removing this Installation</h2>
<p>To remove this <span class="pkg">GAP</span> installation use the
script <code>remove</code> in the 
subdirectory <code>gapsync</code> of your installation:
</p>
<pre>   &lt;path to your installation&gt;/gapsync/remove
</pre>
<p>This just deletes the links to the  scripts mentioned above and the
whole installation directory (starting <code>gap4r4</code>), so including
any custom installations in the <code>gap4r4/local</code> subdirectory.
</p>
<p>You can also just delete or forget about the <code>gapsync</code> script
and use the installed <span class="pkg">GAP</span> like any standard
installation.
</p>

<h2>Notes on this Installation, in Particular Packages</h2>
<p>The <span class="pkg">GAP</span> version is 4.4.12.</p>
<p>Within <span class="pkg">GAP</span> the command 
<code>SuggestUpgrades([]);</code> shows which packages are in 
the distribution. </p>
<p>The packages 
<span class="pkg">Alnuth</span>, 
<span class="pkg">HAP</span>,
<span class="pkg">if</span>, 
<span class="pkg">polymaking</span>, 
<span class="pkg">qaos</span>,
<span class="pkg">singular</span>,  
and 
<span class="pkg">SgpViz</span> 
need or suggest further 
external software, and may not work immediately with full functionality.

<a href="http://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/pkg/hap/README.hap">HAP</a>,
<a href="http://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/pkg/polymaking/doc/chap1.html#X8794FBB27B46C08E">polymaking</a>,

<a
href="http://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/pkg/singular/doc/chap1.html">singular</a>, 
<a
href="http://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/pkg/sgpviz/doc/chap1.html">graphviz</a>
</p>
<p>The package <span class="pkg">linboxing</span> currently doesn't work
with this installation (with statically linked kernel modules).
</p>
<p>Note that the <span class="pkg">AtlasRep</span> package contains
directories <code>gap4r4/pkg/atlasrep/data*</code> which are world writable
(for caching downloaded representations). These are emptied with any update
of this distribution.</p>
<p>If you don't want this you can customize the script
<code>gap4r4/local/bin/gapsync</code> in your installation, add the options 
<code>--exclude=pkg/atlasrep/datagens --exclude=pkg/atlasrep/dataword</code>
to the <code>rsync</code> call (search the line containing
<code>--port</code>).
</p>

<p>
The <span class="pkg">Carat</span> package also needs further installation.
(The external binaries hard code their installation path, so I cannot
prepare them for you.) You need a C-compiler (probably <code>gcc</code>) and 
<code>tar</code>. After update go in the subdirectory <code>./gapsync</code>
from the root of your <span class="pkg">GAP</span> installation and call
there the script <code>./FinishInstallCarat</code>. This will install <span
class="pkg">Carat</span> on i686 systems and install it for the
<code>gap64</code> version on x86_64 systems. The script produces the
necessary binaries and unpacks about 150 MB of data files. Finally, call
<code>gapsync</code> to update your workspace.
</p>

<p><span class="pkg">XGap</span>: There were reports that it doesn't work
properly on Linux systems using the <code>/dev</code> file system, due to 
file permission problems. A proper fix is not yet available. Also, it does
no longer work on some newer systems and it is not possible to compile it on 
64-bit architectures.
</p>

<p>You can customize  details of the installation of
<strong>any  package</strong> by copying that package to the directory
<code>gap4r4/local/pkg</code>. You can also install <strong>additional 
packages</strong> there.</p>
<!--  is this ok now?
<p>Currently, the packages <span class="pkg">Loops</span> and <span class="pkg">RCWA</span> cannot be used at the same time. (The authors will resolve problems with conflicting declarations.)
</p>
-->

<h2><a name="32versus64">Shall I use the 32-bit or 64-bit version of <span
class="pkg">GAP</span>?</a></h2>

<p>
If you have an x86_64 based system you can use both. The 64-bit version uses
for many <span class="pkg">GAP</span> objects twice the memory as the 32-bit
version and this can also make it a bit slower. The 32-bit version of <span
class="pkg">GAP</span> can, depending on the configuration of the Linux
kernel, use at most 2 or 3 Gigabyte of memory (and almost 4 GB on x86_64
systems). So, there are two sitations where you want to use the 64-bit version:
</p>
<ul>
<li>You are mainly using objects in your computations which do take
advantage of the 64-bit architecture, these are compressed vectors and
matrices over small finite fields, very long integers and bit lists.
These objects need essentially the same memory on 32-bit and 64-bit systems
and their basic arithmetic is faster because it works on 64-bit words.
</li>
<li>You really need a lot of memory and have a machine with more than 4 GB
of physical memory. (But recall that many objects use up twice the memory,
in some cases the 64-bit version is only  advantageous if you have even 
more than  8 GB of physical memory!)
</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to use dynamic modules?</h2>

<p>The executables in this distribution are statically linked to make them
as independent as possible of other files in your operating system. But this
means for the <span class="pkg">GAP</span> executable that you cannot use
additional packages with kernel modules (<code>LoadDynamicModule</code> in
<span class="pkg">GAP</span> does not work). 
</p>

<p> If you want to use such packages or develop and test your own, you must
compile <span class="pkg">GAP</span> on your system. An easy way to do that
is the following (assuming you have standard tools like gcc, make
installed):
</p>
<pre>
cd &lt;path to directory containing your gap4r4>
cp -lR gap4r4 gap4r4dyn   # hard links, needs almost no memory
cd gap4r4dyn
rm -rf bin/x86* bin/i686*
make clean
./configure
make
ln -s `pwd`/bin/gap.sh &lt;your bin dir>/gap.dyn
</pre>
<p>Repeat this (except the last line) whenever you change your gap4r4
installation. 
</p>
<p>A few packages may not work with <code>gap.dyn</code>, you have to
recompile them as well. See the files <code>gap4r4/gapsync/InstForRsync{32,64}</code> to see how I compiled the packages.
