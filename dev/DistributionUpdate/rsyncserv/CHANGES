Updated GAP to version 4.4.10.
Added support for a 64-bit version of GAP on x86_64 based systems.
  ---------
  NOTE: if you are updating from previous versions I suggest that you update
  your 'gapsync' script as well. To do this do the same as in the initial
  installation: 
  rsync --port=8731 -azv beteigeuze.math.rwth-aachen.de::gap4r4/gapsync/gapsync .
  ./gapsync

  Give same two paths as in initial installation and say 'y' when asked if
  existing scripts shall be removed. That's it.
  rm ./gapsync
  ---------

Now loading again AtlasRep in default workspace.

   http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~Max.Neunhoeffer/Computer/Software/

may change until the first official release. 

---  Wed, 17 Jan 2007 22:44:06 +0100
Changed shell in 'gapsync' script to '/bin/bash'; 'gapsync' uses some non-POSIX
extensions of bash compared to sh. (In some new Linux distributions 'sh' 
is strictly restricted to POSIX functionality, so we need to call bash
explicitly.)

Prefetched a fix (overwriting lib/oprt.gi and lib/read5.co)

---  Mon, 16 Oct 2006 10:55:04 +0200
Corrected the update to 4.4.8: the new gap-executable was missing
