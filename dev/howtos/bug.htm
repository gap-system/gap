<A NAME="bug"><H2>How do I correct a bug in the released version</H2></A>

See 
<B><A HREF="checkin.htm#fix">How to check in a bugfix</A></B> for
details on how to check in the fix.

<A NAME="wrtap"><H2>How is a bugfix wrapped</H2></A>
A bugfix is wrapped from the information in the file <tt>dev/BUGFIX</tt>
(in the development branch!)
which lists the files that must go in a fix and a description.

<OL>
<LI>Ensure that there are no open bug reports from <tt>gap-trouble</tt>.
<LI>Check out a copy of the released branch (this contains all the fixes
that will go in the bugfix).
<LI>If the fix involves kernel changes, the variable <tt>KERNEL_VERSION</tt>
in <tt>src/system.c</tt> (in the release branch) has to be incremented (and
system.c added to the list of changed files).
<BR>
Furthermore
<tt>lib/version.g</tt> has to be changed to test for the new kernel version
number.
<BR>(You will also have to make sure to get new binaries for Mac and Windows
after the fix is wrapped and before releasing it.)
<LI> Edit <tt>lib/version.g</tt> and increment the bugfix number.
<LI>(Compile and) start GAP in this directory with the <tt>-N</tt> option
and issue the command <tt>CreateCompletionFiles()</tt>.
<LI>Read in the test file <tt>tst/bugfix.tst</tt> (from the development
branch!) to verify that all listed bugs are gone.
<LI>Create a directory (say <tt>FIX</tt>) that looks like the GAP root directory
   (i.e., with subdirectories <tt>lib</tt> <tt>src</tt>...).
<LI> In this directory also create a file <tt>description<i>fixnr</i></tt>
in which you copy the description part of the <tt>BUGFIX</tt> file. If the
fix (or a previous fix) involved kernel changes include the bit about
recompilation.
<LI>
Copy all changed files (as listed in <tt>BUGFIX</tt> from the <B>
release</B> branch (for example the GAP4R3 branch) into the <tt>FIX</tt>
directory (so all changed files from `lib' go into <tt>FIX/lib</tt> etc. ).
<LI>
Path names should not start with <tt>./</tt> as this will cause problems on
the Macintosh platform.
<BR>
Also copy <tt>lib/version.g</tt> and those completion files from
<tt>lib</tt> that have changed. (Check the corresponding <tt>read</tt> files
to see whether changed files are listed in there, if yes, the corresponding
completion file changed as well.) There will be no problem if extra files
are accidentally added to the bugfix.

<LI> Make sure your <tt>umask</tt> and the permissions of the files to wrap
are set (at least temporarily) to global read/execute -- otherwise the
archived files will have restricted permissions.

<LI>
In <tt>FIX</tt> archive with <tt>zoo</tt> the directories that contain
something (e.g., if the changed files are in `src', `lib', and `tom' (say),
then 
<DL>
<DD>
<TT>zoo ah fix4r3n2.zoo lib/* src/* tom/* description2</tt>
</DL>
will do it).
<BR>
All files also need a comment that they are text. For that the following will work in a c-shell:
<DL>
<DD><tt>
% > foreach i (lib/*)<BR>
foreach? zoo c fix4r3n2.zoo $i &lt;TEXTCOM<BR>
foreach? end</BR>
</tt>
</DL>
Here TEXTCOM is a text file containing the following lines
<DL><DD><tt>
!TEXT!
/END
</tt>
</DL>
It is possible to check whether the files in the fix have the comment by 
<DL><DD><tt>
zoo lc fix4r3n2.zoo
</tt>
</DL>
This should produce a list of all files in the fix, and all should have
a comment.


<LI>
Apply the fix to the copy of the distribution, and try the testfile
`bugfix.tst'.  (For this it is a good idea to also have a copy of the
released version somewhere.)

<LI>
Similarly run `testall' to check that nothing got broken.
 
<LI> If the kernel has changed, ask Burkhard Hoefling for new Macintosh
    binaries (b.hoefling@tu-bs.de).

<LI>
If the kernel has changed, a new Windows binary needs to be prepared.
    For that go to the Windows machine, and go to the directory containing
    a copy of the release (e.g., <tt>C:\GAP4R3\</tt>). Put the .zoo file of the
    fix in there, and unzoo. Then start cygwin, and go to the directory
    where the fix was unzooed. Type <tt>make</tt>, which produces a binary in
    <tt>bin\i586******\gap.exe</tt>. Then copy (e.g., via ftp) <tt>gap.exe</tt> to 
    <tt>FIX/bin/gapw95.exe</tt>.
    It is a good idea to have a copy of `cygwin1.dll' in that same directory
    (there are Windows users who install `basic4r3.zoo' which does not contain
    that file, and get the latest binary; putting it in there will avoid
    answering about two questions every 5 months). Then issue
    <DL>
    <DD></tt>zoo ah wbin4r3n2.zoo bin/*</tt>
    </DL>
    which produces the zoo file containing the binary.

<LI> Try installing the Windows binary (preferrably again in a separate
copy of GAP), and try the testexamples.

<LI>
In order to put the files on the ftp server, become root on chrystal.
    Put the fix, and the windows binary in
 
	 <DL>
         <DD><tt>/user5/ftp/pub/gap/gap4/bugfixes</tt>
	 </DL>

    (and issue <tt>chgrp ftp *</tt> and <tt>chmod 444 *</tt>).
         
    Put the .zoo file containing the Windows binary also in

	 <DL>
         <DD><tt>/user5/ftp/pub/gap/gap4/bin/win</tt>
	 </DL>

    Put the Mac binaries in

	 <DL>
         <DD><tt>/user5/ftp/pub/gap/gap4/bin/mac</tt>
	 </DL>

    NOTE: if there are no new binaries then changing the webpages 
    (see below) will change the references to the binaries (e.g.,
    if there is a second bugfix, but no second binary fix, then
    `wbin4r3n2.zoo' will become `wbin4r3n3.zoo' on the webpages). 
    In this case, a symbolic link will solve the problem.


<LI>
For editing the web pages one has to become gap (on chrystal, to get
    the file sizes later on). Go to <tt>/gap/WWW/Info4</tt>, and edit
    `bugfixes.input' (add a few lines on the latest bugfix, and links).
    COMMIT `bugfixes.input' (in cvs), otherwise the mirrors will not 
    get the fixes.
    Also edit <tt>/gap/WWW/Util/DEFAULTS</tt> and cvs commit (change the version 
    number).
    Finally go to <tt>/gap/WWW</tt> and issue <tt>make stand</tt>; this will produce
    the file sizes.

<LI>
Finally update the <tt>BUGFIX</tt> file to reflect the status after this bugfix:
Increment the bugfix number,
move the descriptions (without credits) in the list of older corrections,
but keep the list of changed files as it is (we will make fixes comprehensive).

<LI>
Send the announcement to the GAP Forum.
    Go to a pub without internet access.
