Filenames
=========

Files are identified by filenames, which are represented in {\GAP} as
strings.  Filenames can be created directly by the user or a program,
but of course this is system dependent.

Filenames for some files can be constructed in a system independent way
using the following functions.  This is done by first getting a directory
object for the directory the file resides in, and then constructing the
filename.


'DirectoryCurrent()'

'DirectoryCurrent' returns the directory object for the current
directory.  Under UNIX this would simply represent the empty string.


'DirectoryTemporary( <hint> )'

'DirectoryTemporary' returns the directory object for a temporary
directory.  This is guaranteed to be newly created and empty immediately
after the call to 'DirectoryTemporary'.  {\GAP} will make a reasonable
effort to remove this directory either when a garbage collection collects
the directory object or upon termination of the {\GAP} job that created
the directory.  <hint> should be used by 'DirectoryTemporary' to
construct the name of the directory (but 'DirectoryTemporary' is free to
use only a part of <hint>), and must be a string of at most 8
alphanumerical characters.  Under UNIX this would usually represent
'/usr/tmp/<hint>_<proc_id>_<cnt>/', e.g., '/usr/tmp/guava_17188_1/'.


-- 'DirectoryName( <name> )'
-- 
-- 'DirectoryName' returns the directory object for the directory with the
-- (system dependent) name <name>, which must be a string.
--
-- MAYBE NOT USEABLE AFTER ALL, NOT IMPLEMENTED


'DirectoriesLibrary( [<lib>] )'

'DirectoriesLibrary' returns the directories object for the {\GAP}
library <lib>, which must be one of '"lib"' (the default), '"grp"',
'"tbl"', and so on.  Under UNIX this would usually represent
'<gap-dir>/<lib>/', e.g., '/usd/gap/4.0/lib/', or the list of library
directories specified using {\GAP}'s '-l' command option.


'DirectoriesPackagePrograms( <name-pkg> )'

'DirectoriesPackagePrograms' returns the directories object for the
directories where the executable programs for the contributed package
<name-pkg> reside.  Under UNIX this would usually represent
'<gap-dir>/bin/<hostname>/<name-pkg>/', e.g.,
'/usd/gap/4.0/bin/beaker/guava/'.


'DirectoriesPackageLibrary( <name-pkg> [, <lib>] )'

'DirectoriesPackageLibrary' returns the directories object for the
library <lib>, which must be one of '"lib"', '"grp"', and so on, for the
contributed package <name-pkg>.  Under UNIX this would usually represent
'<gap-dir>/pkg/<name-pkg>/<lib>/', e.g., '/usd/gap/4.0/pkg/guava/lib/'.


'DirectoriesSystemPrograms()'

'DirectoriesSystemPrograms' returns the directories object for the list
of directories where the system programs reside.  Under UNIX this would
usually rerpresent |${PATH}|, e.g., '/bin/;/usr/bin/;/usr/local/bin/'.


'Filename( <dir>, <name> )'

'Filename' returns the (system dependent) filename (as a string) for the
file with name <name> in the directory <dir>.  If <dir> is a directory
object, then 'Filename' returns the filename regardless of whether the
directory contains a file <name> or not.  If <dir> is a directories
object, i.e., if it represents a list of directories (possibly of length
1), then 'Filename' will search the directories in order, and will return
the filename for the file <name> in the first directory which contains a
file <name> or 'fail' if no directory contains a file <name>.  For
portability <name> should be a string of at most 8 alphanumerical
characters optinally followed by a dot '.' and between 1 and 3
alphanumerical characters.


File Operations
===============

There are certain operations that can be performed on the file.

'IsExistingFile( <name-file> )'

'IsExistingFile' returns 'true' if a file with the filename <name-file>
exists, and 'false' otherwise.


'IsReadableFile( <name-file> )'

'IsReadableFile' returns 'true' if a file with the filename <name-file>
exists and the {\GAP} process has read permissions for the file, and
'false' otherwise.


'IsWriteableFile( <name-file> )'

'IsWriteableFile' returns 'true' if a file with the filename <name-file>
exists and the {\GAP} process has write permissions for the file, and
'false' otherwise.


'IsExecuteableFile( <name-file> )'

'IsExecuteableFile' returns 'true' if a file with the filename <name-file>
exists and the {\GAP} process has execute permissions for the file, and
'false' otherwise.  Note that execute permissions do not imply that it is
possible to execute the file, e.g., it could be an executable for a
different machine.


'RemoveFile( <name-file> )'

'RemoveFile' removes the file with the name <name-file>, and returns
'true' if that was sucessful and 'false' if it failed.


'RemoveDirectory( <dir> )'

'RemoveDirectory' removes a temporary directory <dir>.


Input/Output Streams
====================

In {\GAP} files can be accessed as *streams*.  *Input stream* deliver
characters to {\GAP} which *reads* them from the stream.  When an input
stream has delivered all characters it is at <end-of-stream>.  *Output
streams* receive characters from {\GAP} which *writes* them to the
stream.  Streams differ in their treatment of <end-of-line> and
non-printable characters.  *Text streams* translate the <end-of-line>
character ('\n') to the systems representation of <end-of-line> (e.g.,
<new-line> under UNIX and Mac OS X, <carriage-return> under Mac OS 9,
<carriage-return>-<new-line> under DOS, implicit under VMS), and the
behaviour for nonprintable characters are undefined.  *Binary streams* do
not translate the <end-of-line> character and allow nonprintable
characters.


'InputTextNone'

'InputTextNone' is a dummy input stream, which delivers no characters,
i.e., it is always at end of stream.  Its main use is for calls to
'Process' when the started program does not read anything.


'OutputTextNone'

'OutputTextNone' is a dummy output stream, which discards all received
characters.  Its main use is for calls to 'Process' when the started
program does not write anything.


'InputTextUser'

'InputTextUser' is the input stream that delivers the characters that the
user types.  If {\GAP}'s input comes from a file (input redirection),
then 'InputTextUser' will deliver the characters from that file.


'OutputTextUser'

'OutputTextUser' is the output stream that presents to the user all
received characters.  If {\GAP}'s output goes to a file (output
redirection), then 'OutputTextUser' will receive characters to that file.


'InputTextString( <string> )'

'InputTextString' returns an input stream that delivers the characters
from the string <string>.


'OutputTextString( <list>, <append> )'

'OutputTextString' returns an output stream that puts all received
characters into the list <list>.  If <append> is 'false', then the list
is emptied first, otherwise received characters are added at the end of
the list.


'InputTextFile( <name-file> )'

'InputTextFile' returns an input stream that delivers the characters
from the file <name-file>.


'OutputTextFile( <name-file>, <append> )'

'OutputTextFile' returns an output stream that writes received characters
to the file <file-name>.  If <append> is 'false', then the file is
emptied first, otherwise received characters are added at the end of the
list.


'InputBinaryFile( <name-file> )'

'InputBinaryFile' returns a binary input stream that delivers the
characters from the file <name-file>.


'OutputBinaryFile( <name-file>, <append> )'

'OutputBinaryFile' returns a binary output stream that writes received
characters to the file <file-name>.  If <append> is 'false', then the
file is emptied first, otherwise received characters are added at the end
of the list.


'CloseInput( <stream-in>  )'

'CloseInput' closes the input stream <stream-in>.  It is an error to try
to read characters from a closed input stream.  Closing a stream tells
the {\GAP} kernel and/or the operating system kernel that the file is no
longer needed.  This may be necessary because the {\GAP} kernel and/or
the operating system may impose a limit on how may streams may be open at
once.  An open stream is closed when the garbage collection collects the
stream object.


'CloseOutput( <stream-out> )'

'CloseOutput' closes the output stream <stream-out>.  It is an error to
try to write characters to a closed output stream.  Closing a stream
tells the {\GAP} kernel and/or the operating system kernel that the file
is no longer needed.  This may be necessary because the {\GAP} kernel
and/or the operating system may impose a limit on how may streams may be
open at once.  An open stream is closed when the garbage collection
collects the stream object.


Processes
=========

'Process(<dir-exec>,<name-prg>,<stream-in>,<stream-out>,<options-arguments>)'

'Process' runs a new process.  'Process' returns when the process
terminates.  It returns the return value of the process (if the operating
system supports such a concept).

<dir-exec> specifies the directory in which the process is run, and
should be the result of 'DirectoryCurrent', 'DirectoryTemporary', or
'DirectoryName'.

<name-prg> is the file name of the program to launch, for portability it
should be the result of 'Filename' and should pass 'CouldExecFile'.  Note
that 'Process' does no searching through a list of directories, this is
done by 'Filename'.

<stream-in> is the input stream that delivers the characters to the
process.  For portability it should either be 'InputTextNone' (if the
process reads no characters), or 'InputTextUser', or the result of a call
to 'InputTextFile' from which no characters have been read.

<stream-out> is the output stream which receives the characters from the
process.  For portability it should either be 'OutputTextNone' (if the
process writes no characters), or 'OutputTextUser', or the result of a
call to 'OutputTextFile' to which no characters have been written.

<options-arguments> is a list of strings which are passed to the process
as command line argument.  Note that no substitutions are performed on
the strings, i.e., they are passed immediately to the process and are not
processed by a command interpreter (shell).  Further note that each
string is passed as one argument, even if it contains <space> characters.


'InputTextProcess(<dir-exec>,<name-prg>,<stream-in>,<options-arguments>)'

'InputTextProcess' runs a new process.  'InputTextProcess' returns
immediately after launching the process.  It returns an input stream that
delivers the characters that the process writes.  When the process has
terminated and all characters have been read, the input stream is at
<end-of-stream>.

<dir-exec>, <name-prg>, <stream-in>, and <options-arguments> are the same
as for 'Process'.


'OutputTextProcess(<dir-exec>,<name-prg>,<stream-out>,<options-arguments>)'

'OutputTextProcess' runs a new process.  'OutputTextProcess' returns
immediately after launching the process.  It returns an output stream
that sends all received characters to the process.  When the output
stream is closed, then <end-of-file> will be send to the process (which
may continue to run).

<dir-exec>, <name-prg>, <stream-out>, and <options-arguments> are the same
as for 'Process'.


'InputTextOutputTextProcess(<dir-exec>,<name-prg>,<options-arguments>)'

'InputTextOutputTextProcess' runs a new process.  It returns immediately
after launching the process.  It returns a list of length 2.  The first
element of that list is an input stream that delivers the characters that
the process writes.  When the process has terminated and all characters
have been read, the input stream is at <end-of-stream>. The second
element of that list in an output that sends all received characters to
the process.  When the output stream is closed then <end-of-file> will be
send to the process (which may continue to run).

<dir-exec>, <name-prg>, and <options-arguments> are the same as for
'Process'.


Stream Operations
=================

'ReadByte( <stream-in> )'
'ReadLine( <stream-in> )'
'ReadAll( <stream-in> )'

'ReadByte', 'ReadLine',  and 'ReadAll' return  one character (returned
as integer), one line (returned as string without the newline), or all
characters (returned as string) from the input stream <stream-in>.

'ReadByte' waits until  a character is  available, 'ReadLine' reads in
the input until a newline is read, 'ReadAll'  reads in the input until
the stream is at end-of-stream.

If <stream-in> is the input stream of a input/output process, they may
also return 'fail' if the process is also trying to read.


'ReadBytes( <stream-in>, <length> )'

returns a byte-stream of length <length> or less.


'WriteByte( <stream-out>, <char> )'
'WriteLine( <stream-out>, <line> )'
'WriteAll( <stream-out>, <string> )'

'WriteChar', 'WriteLine', and 'WriteAll' write a character, a line, or a
string to the output stream <stream-out>.  If <stream-out> is the output
stream of a input/output process, they may return 'fail' if the process
terminates before accepting the character, line, or string.

'WriteBytes( <stream-out>, <stream-byte>, <length> )'

writes <length> bytes to <stream-out> using the byte-stream <stream-byte>
as input.

'IsEndOfStream( <stream-in> )'

'IsEndOfStream' returns 'true' if the input stream is at <end-of-stream>,
and 'false' otherwise.  'IsEndOfStream' might return 'false' even if
the next 'ReadByte' fails.

'ErrorStream( <stream-in> )'

'ErrorStream' returns a string describing the error condition (if any)
for the input stream <stream-in>.  If no error happened for <stream-in>
it returns 'fail'.


Example
=======

name_date   := Filename( DirectoriesSystemPrograms(), "date" );
if not CouldExecFile( name_date )  then Error("cannot execute 'date'");  fi;
stream_date := OutputTextProcess( DirectoryCurrent(), name_date, InputTextNone, [] );
output_date := ReadAll( stream_date );
CloseOutputText( stream_date );
