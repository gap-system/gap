    - Dixon's algorithm for constructing representations
    - Schur multiplier and Schur Cover for permutation groups are available
    - linear groups over rings Z/mZ are available
    - the MeatAxe has been extended
    - new methods for polycyclic and almost crystallographic groups
    - improved handling of finitely presented groups
    - improved handling of permutation groups and their homomorphisms

  * performance  enhancements in  many areas, including 
    - faster arithmetic for matrices and matrix groups over finite fields
    - faster methods for large degree permutation groups 
    - faster solvable quotient and Knuth-Bendix methods
    - various improvements in the GAP kernel

  * extensions  to  the data libraries, including
    - transitive permutation groups up to degree 30
    - irreducible maximal finite integral matrix groups up to degree 31 
    - character tables 

  * improvements of various interfaces, including
    - help system
    - kernel hooks 
    - packages
