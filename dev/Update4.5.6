%W  Update                      GAP Maintenance
%%
%%
%Y  Copyright (C)  2005,  Lehrstuhl D fÃ¼r Mathematik,  RWTH Aachen,  Germany
%%
%%  This file is intended to list the changes that will be published with
%%  the next GAP release.
%%
%%  The information is used for producing:
%%  - the update announcement
%%  - additions to `tst/bugfix.tst'
%%  - an HTML page that lists known bugs and intended new features
%%  - an entry in the `Changes' manual describing the new release.
%%
%%  This file contains two sections: 
%%  - changes in the stable branch (e.g. to make GAP 4.5.7 after GAP 4.5.6)
%%  - changes in the default branch (e.g. to make GAP 4.6 after GAP 4.5.17)
%% 
%%  How to make sure that the change goes into right place:
%%
%%  - for adding a change in the stable branch, call 'hg update stable-4.5',
%%    then just copy one of the templates below to the end of the stable
%%    branch section and enter the relevant information.
%%
%%  - for adding a change in the default branch, call 'hg update default',
%%    then just copy one of the templates below to the end of the default
%%    branch section and enter the relevant information.
%%
%%  DO NOT enter descriptions of any changes in the default branch into
%%  the version of this file from the stable branch !!!
%%
%%  Formal rules for this file, to allow simple parsing by a script:
%%          - lines starting with `%' are comments and are ignored
%%          - lines starting with `!' describe the type of information
%%            in the following lines until the next `!'-line (therefore, 
%%            information must be entered *after* and not *in* `!'-lines)
%%          - each entry must be finished with an `! End' line, otherwise
%%            the order of entries is irrelevant
%%          - the text behind the `!' is case and whitespace insensitive
%%
%%  To describe the change, you need to fill in least the following fields
%%  in one of the templates below: "Date", "Changed by", "Type of Change",
%%  "Description" and "Changeset". Also, fill in "Reported by", if
%%  applicable, and, if relevant, provide some code in test file format 
%%  in "Test Code".
%%

%%%%%%% Template with explanatory comments (the shorter one is below) %%%%%%%
% [Required] When the change was checked in, format 'yyyy/mm/dd':
! Date

% [Required] Initials should suffice here:
! Changed by

% [Optional] Only if applicable:
! Reported by

% [Required] Choose one or more entries and/or add new ones; 
% but always use either the 'Fix:' or the 'New:' prefix
! Type of Change
Fix: wrong result
Fix: inappropriate error message
Fix: infinite loop
Fix: efficiency issue
Fix: crash
New: extended functionality
New: new functionality
New: improved documentation

% [Required] For the description use plain text
! Description

% [Optional, but highly desirable] If possible, provide some code 
% in test file format which allows to check if a change was applied 
% to an installation. Provide input and output, including prompts, 
% exactly as in a GAP session.
! Test Code

% [Optional] If possible, provide some information about a temporary fix, 
% workaround etc., maybe with a link to some longer description or a file 
% with some code. Use plain text here.
! Prefetch

% [Required] Describe here how to find out where the changes were made. 
% - for immediate changes in the stable branch, specify changed file(s).
%   Adding the entry describing the change should be a part of the same 
%   commit as the change itself, so that adding/merging/backing out the 
%   change fix will keep dev/Update in sync. If you will need to revisit 
%   this change before the next GAP release, please update also its entry 
%   in dev/Update file, specifying the full hexadecimal changeset id 
%   (160-bit identifier) of the previous change(s).
% - for changes made in feature branches, the change to dev/Update should
%   be made in the same feature branch, so it will be merged into default
%   or stable branch together with actual changes and reverting the merge
%   will also revert the dev/Update file. Specify here the name of the 
%   feature branch and possibly the full hexadecimal changeset id (160-bit 
%   identifier) of the latest revision of the code in this branch before 
%   the merge. 
% Since by default, Mercurial displays only the first 12 characters of
% the full hexadecimal changeset id, to see the full version, use --debug 
% option, e.g. 'hg --debug log'. Do not use the short revision number 
% since it makes sense only within your clone.
! Changeset

% [Required] Finish your entry with this:

Fix: crash
! Description
GAP would crash when parsing certain syntactically invalid code. This crash
was introduced by commit a5b5807c964d, which this fix simply reverts.
Note that the bad commit was meant to "Get rid of one break loop related bug."
However, it is unclear what that bug might have been. So it seems better
to fix the known crash; and then fix the original bug, if it reappears.

Fix: crash
! Description
Fixed and improved command line editing without readline support.

A combination of UP and DOWN arrows could lead to a segfault, this is fixed.
In case of saved history, UP after starting GAP yields last stored line.
Now using user preference "HistoryMaxLines" when storing and saving history.

Fix: wrong result
! Description
Fixed a method for coefficients which, after Gaussian elimination, did not
check that the coefficients actually lie in the left-acting-domain of the
vector space. This could lead to a wrong answer in a vector space
membership test.

New: new functionality

! Description

Added a kernel function MEET_BLIST which returns
true if the two blists have true in any common position
and false otherwise. Useful for representing subsets of 
a fixed set by blists.

! Test Code
gap> a := BlistList([1,2,3],[1]);;
gap> b := BlistList([1,2,3],[2]);;
gap> c := BlistList([1,2,3],[2,3]);;
gap> MEET_BLIST(a,b);
false
gap> MEET_BLIST(a,c); 
false
gap> MEET_BLIST(b,c);
true
