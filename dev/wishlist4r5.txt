The initials at the end of an entry show who has added this entry, they do
*not* automatically mean that the same person will work on it. Please add
a remark if you want to work on an entry.
Use '*' to mark each topic, and '-' for the subtopics.

* fix the bugs listed in the file ./KnownBugs.txt

* Enhance the commands like 'SymplecticGroup' by introducing an optional
  argument that specifies a symplectic/orthogonal form. Add utilities for
  transforming the groups with respect to different form into each other.
  (Proposed by Christoph Köhler, will try to urge him to implement this.)
      (FL)

* - Improve the performance of the integer arithmetic, e.g. by using GMP.
      (SK)
  - There is also "NTL: A Library for doing Number Theory", see
    http://www.shoup.net/ntl/
    (MC)

* Extend the help functions by fuzzy search facilities,
  such that for example `?ChracterTable' finds something reasonable.
  It is not necessary to implement this from scratch in GAP,
  and it should be applicable to arbitrary texts (i.e. not be hidden inside
  the help functions).  (TB)
  The page
  http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/ch09s01.html#bayes_spam
  could suggest some ideas about it. (MC)
  Also, search for 'agrep' and its documentation. (FL)

* Document 'RemoveCharacters', 'TranslateString' (if they turned out
  useful). Throw away IS_SUBSTRING and STRING_LOWER (or at least move to
  'obsolete.g').  I will do before the release. (FL)

* Make workspaces more popular:
    - discuss handling of command line options (interesting case '-r')
      and implement it
    - find out how this works on Win/Mac
    - discuss handling of streams and implement it (see mail
      of Marco Costantini to gap-dev from Thu, 15 Apr 2004)
      and implement it
    - change installation instructions to *suggest* the creation of
      workspaces
    (FL)

* Correct section "Command Line Options" in ref manual and in 'gap -h':
    many options "toggle" a setting.
    (FL and MC)
    - What about using enable/disable or disable/enable depending on the
      default behaviour? (SL)
    - option 'gap -V': display version number and exit
    - are the command line options the standard ones? See
      http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/ch10s05.html#id2948149
      (MC)

* Either fix the compatibility mode for gap3 (if it is simple to do)
  or
  say that it is no more supported (the section "Command Line Options" in
  ref manual still contain the option "-O" to enable it). (MC)

* last2 and last3 in break loops. (MC)

* The order of chapters in ref manual should be checked, in particular,
  find a better place for "Transformations", and "p-adic Numbers". (MC)

* Either:
  the monomial orderings should be implemented as orderings, and orderings
  as binary relations (they told me in my first year algebra course that
  orderings are binary relations),
  or
  the documentation should say that, at least for the moment, in Gap a
  monomial ordering is not an ordering and an ordering is not a binary
  relation.
  It may be nice having a general implementation to handle in the same way
  ordering, monomial orderings, antisymmetric transitive binary relations,
  lattices (including subgroup lattices), and the graphic lattices  of
  xgap package.
  (MC)

* When a 'LoadPackage("something");' fails, it would be useful to have a
  warning that informs the user why LoadPackage failed: for instance:
  "package something unknown" or "missing required package somethingelse"
  or so. In particular for a less experienced user this can likely save a
  significant amount of time. Similar for "SuggestUpgrades", as it says:
  "The following GAP packages are present but cannot be used."
  (MC and SK)

* Correct `Where()' to return the precise position (statement or line).
  (SK and AK)

* Fix the `DownEnv()' problem in break loops reported by Marco and a few
  others. (This problem can cause GAP to crash, but is not easy to trigger).
  See the file ./KnownBugs.txt
  (SK)

* Limit the amount of output when not explicitly `Print'ing or `Display'ing
  something, either by
  - implementing `ViewObj' methods applicable in practically all relevant
    cases or by
  - providing a default `ViewObj' method in the kernel which truncates the
    output after a given number of lines which can be set by the user. (SK)

* marcus@math.uic.edu asked (in gap-forum) to have colors like in gap4.3
  FL:  I will put a version of 'colorprompt.g' in lib and document it
  To be discussed: enable/disable colored prompt by cmdline argument?

* As I use IsPolynomialRingIdeal, I would like that this function will
  be documented, instead to remain among the "Undocumented Variables"
  (MC)

* Read lib/lbutil.g into library. Put the documentation in the manual.
  (FL)

* Provide simple, clear, reliable and up to date instructions about
  writing a new gap package. Problems with such instructions will prevent
  users from providing packages with the code the have written.
  See also the thread "zoo packaging" in the devel list of May 2004.
  (MC)

*  - Check the various todo/wish lists: KnownBugs.txt, TODO, TODO4.3,
     essential4r4.txt, gap5.txt, road.tex, sacks.tex, wishlist4r4.txt,
     http://www.math.colostate.edu/~hulpke/projects/projects.htm
   - Clean the already implemented features and (if appropriate)
     add then in a NEWFEATURES file.
   - Have an (almost) unique todo/wish list.
   - There are also two howto directories: dev/howtos and HOWTOS, is
     this appropriate?
   (MC)

* If there is someone willing to make some practice in networking
  programming in C, then some network facilities could be provided in Gap.
  For instance SuggestUpgrades can ask the gap site for the latest versions,
  and InputOutputRemoteProcess (similar to InputOutputLocalProcess) can be
  provided. See also http://monet.nag.co.uk/mkm/deliv41.pdf, paragraph 6.1.
  (MC)

* There is an algorithm for factoring polynomials over finite fields with
  Drinfeld modules at
  http://www.ams.org/journal-getitem?pii=S0025-5718-04-01691-6
  (MC)

* Sort out naming conventions: `IsMatrix', `IsRectangularTable'
  (cp. mail thread `Strange matrices' on gap-dev starting June 17, 2003.)
  (SK)

* There is a misleading message with InputFromUser, caused by the line
  1802 in the file src/streams.c:
  Pr("#W Warning -- reading to  end of input tty will never end\n",0,0);
  Is such a warning necessary? Can be replaced by something like
  "Press <enter> when done" ?
  (MC)

* Make `ReadTest' print the line numbers in the test file where
  differences occur. (SK)

* Let V be a vector space of dimension d, and A1, A2 two affine subspaces
  of V. I would like to have a method to compute the Intersection( A1, A2)
  using a time polynomial in d (this can be done with linear algebra
  methods). At the moment, Gap computes the pointwise intersection, and
  this requires a time exponential in d (and it's possible only if the
  LeftActingDomain is finite).
  (MC).

* Some packages require external binaries, and so are available only under
  Unix. It would useful to supply also precompiled binaries for windows.
  (There is qemu http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/qemu/ for producing
  windows binaries under linux.)
  (MC)

* The output of ReadTest depends on the value of SizeScreen()[1]. It would
  be better to make it independent.
  (MC)

* Lev Pliner <pliner@sky.ru> asked in Gap forum:
 Is there a way how saved workspace can be loaded in the working instance of
 GAP? Somthing like:
 gap> LoadWorkspace ("savefile");

* Clean up functions for sets (AddSet etc.): 
    - remove argument checking (in particular sortedness) from kernel
      functions in src/set.c
    - provide GAP level interface functions with and without checking 
      (AddSet and AddSetNC, etc.), probably using the same kernel function
    - check if  kernel functions in src/set.c can be thrown away completely
      by using a more generic function like COPY_LIST_ENTRIES on GAP level.
    (FL)

* How about implementing more list data types in the kernel, like balanced
  binary trees or so (see Knuth, of AHU).  (FL)

* Better error messages when operations are called with arguments which
  do not lie in the filters given in the declaration (see Devel mails
  with subject "Error messages when trying to change immutable lists"
  from Sep 8, 2004). (SK)
