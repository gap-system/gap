% Comments:
-6 Turn the various lists of special words into tables?
  Or better make them accessible as lists of GAP strings?
-5 What exactly is a keyword?  The statement that this is ``a reserved word''
  in section ``Symbols'' does not say anything.
  And after an explicit list of ``the'' keywords,
  another list of ``keywords because of technical reasons'' is shown,
  which is confusing.
  Also confusing is the statement:  ``The only consequence of this is that
  those identifiers cannot be re-assigned, and ...''
  However, we have also the feature that ordinary identifiers can be
  protected from overwriting, so this is not a meaningful criterion.
-5 In section ``Identifiers'', it is emphasized that `\*' is an identifier
  and not a keyword.
  This suggests that `*' in fact is a keyword. Is it?
-5 Once again identifiers:
  ``An identifier usually consists ...'' is not a sensible formulation for a
  definition, which one expects in the section ``Identifiers''.
  (There are several such vague formulations where precise statements would
  be desirable.)
-6 Several sections show syntax constructs which cannot be expressed using
  <ManSection> (and <A>) elements, for example `<A>function-var</A>()',
  `<A>left-expr</A> = <A>right-expr</A>', `<A>procedure-var</A>();'.
  How to deal with this?
  (Moreover, there are some cases where the ``declaration line'' does not
  fit onto one line.)
-6 Section ``For'' contained a piece of pseudo code, distinguishing
  keywords and constants from variable names.
  How to write this in GAPDoc?
-5 What is the `continue' statement good for?
  (At least the example shown is not striking.)
-5 The section ``The Syntax in BNF'' was commented out.
  (``A few recent additions to the syntax may be missing from this definition.''
  What is a definition good for that is by definition not correct?
  And the table in this section is too long; the lower part is not visible,
  and one gets a lot of LaTeX error messages when processing the manual.)
  It would still be desirable to have a correct definition of the GAP syntax.

   Display > ViewObj > PrintObj > DisplayString > ViewString > String

   makes sense have a PrintObj method as well as String to save memory.
 --> This is done and documented. Discussion on gap-dev needed.

% Comments:
-4 `IsInternalRep' is mentioned but not documented.
-6   These and the next point could be done with Subsections  and some
     sensible Index entries.
     Actually, 'list[ pos ]' is a shortcut for '\[\](list, pos)'  which
     can be documented with a standard ManSection. (Similar for the other
     cases below.) (FL)
     Looking at that Chapter, maybe this point can be marked +?
  GAPDoc issue:
  In the section ``List Elements'', the notation `list[ pos ]' is
  introduced, which cannot be used in `ManSection';
  how to write this down?.
  Similar questions arise with `list{ poss }', `list[ pos ] := object',
  or `list1 = list2', `list1 <> list2', `list1 < list2', `list1 <= list2'.
-6 GAPDoc issue:
  The `ManSections' about `IsBound' and `Unbind' for lists show the argument
  `list[n]', which can be interpreted as a contradiction to the syntax for
  optional arguments.
  (GAPDoc turns this into list[, n] --viewed as optional argument!)
  (The optimal solution would be to introduce, recommend, and document
  a two-argument syntax for these operations.)
-5 There is a section title ``Comparisons of Lists'' and an index entry
  ``comparisons!of lists'' (i.e., ``of lists'' is a subkey);
  the idea behind the index entry is that several subkeys will appear
  under the index entry ``comparisons''.
  A side-effect is that the online help finds two matches, one for the
  section and one for the index entry, which point to the same place.
  How to deal with this?
-5 If ranges will be generalized in GAP 4.5,
  the restrictions on bounds and length of ranges have to be dropped.
  Yes, adjust the documentation once this is actually implemented.
-6 `ListX' documentation:
  how to write down formatted/indented pseudo code, with comments
  in ordinary text, with <M> and <A> elements etc.
-3 `lists.xml' contains a section ``More about Sets'' from the GAP 3.4 manual
  that was commented out already in the 4.4 manual.
  What to do with this text?
  --> Take out the relevant parts of this and put it into section
      "Sorted Lists and Sets"
      However: Do we want to document the TNUM business storing
      denseness and sortedness???
-5 Mentioned undocumented functions `UnionSet', `IntersectionSet' from
   coll.gi, which are also methods for more general operations `Union' and
   `Intersection'. It may be worth to document them properly.
-3 why is IsRange a category not a property?
  (clean up IsRange vs. ConvertToRangeRep?)
  --> Fix together with the ranges.
      Note that IsRange on Plain lists works and can silently change
      the representation to range representation.
  --> Rethink when we have more general ranges.

-3 `OnLines' and other action functions promise an error when the argument
  point is not normalized,
  but this is not true for `OnLines'.
  `OnSets' does not tell what happens if the argument set is not a set,
  but runs into an error in this case.
  1. I think that the predefined action functions should behave the same
     with respect to tests of the conditions on their arguments,
     and this should be documented consistently.
     (Currently there is a section ``Action on canonical representatives''
     *behind* the introduction of the action functions.)
  2. Aren't such tests an unnecessary overhead?
     (If we really want to have foolproof behaviour here, we could introcude
     `NC' variants, and change all the occurrences in the library ...)
-5* `Orbit': The action function is optional - this is now clear.
    (The whole chapter should be checked for consistency.)
    We checked and stated the default value of action. May be improved by
    cross-ref to the place where all other optional arguments (Omega, pnt,
    gens, acts) are explained.
-4 `OrbitStabilizer' and `StabilizerOfExternalSet':
  What does the statement ``The stabilizer must have G as its parent.'' mean?
  The function *constructs* this stabilizer, so there is no requirement on
  the arguments, or?
  (And for `OrbitStabilizer', there is no description what the return value
  is ...)

-6* GAPDoc issue:
  When a declaration line is too long, such as the first one for
  `ActionHomomorphism', then it is not left aligned in the PDF version.
  Can this be fixed easily?
-3 Is it really needed to call `ActionHomomorphism' with a result of
  `Action' (``for GAP 3 compatibility'')?
  In other words, is `Action' really required to store information about
  the arguments in its return value?
-3 `SparseActionHomomorphism': What does the sentence ``If G acts on a
   very large domain Omega not surjectively'' mean?
  Is surjective here the same as transitive?
  (Several formulations in this chapter sound strange.)
-3 `ActorOfExternalSet': This works only if
   `CanonicalRepresentativeDeterminatorOfExternalSet' is available, or?
-3 `IsTransitive': The definition does not assume that the group really
  acts on the domain given. So for example the ``action on'' any singleton
  set is always regarded as transitive. Is this a meaningful definition?

  Does it make sense to show a fake ``example'' of ``a group of degree
  231000'', where the input data (the generators) are not described?
  Would it be sensible to have the full example somewhere on the GAP
  web pages, and to refer to this from the Reference Manual?

  In fact there is few support for more general situations,

  GAP is almost useless for dealing with R-modules where R is a ring that
  is not a field and not Z.
  And the distinction between left modules w.r.t. scalar action and right
  modules w.r.t. an algebra action (e.g., via matrices on row vectors)
  is not described.
  All this should be sorted out.
