!! Type of Change
Fix: crash

!! Description
A combination of two bugs in GAP could lead to a segfault. First off,
NullMat (and various other GAP functions), when asked to produce matrix
over a small field, called ConvertToMatrixRep(). After this, if the user
tried to changed one of the entries to a value from a larger extension
field, this resulted in an error. (This is now fixed).

Unfortunately, the C code catching this error had a bug and allowed
users to type "return" to continue while ignoring the conversion
error. This was a bad idea, as the C code would be in an inconsistent
state at this point, subsequently leading to a crash.

This, too, has been fixed, by not allowing the user to ignore the error
by entering "return".

! Test Code
gap> n := NullMat(2,2,0*Z(2));; n[1][1] := Z(4);;
gap> Display(n);
z = Z(4)
 z^1   .
   .   .
gap> m := NullMat(2,2,0*Z(2));; ConvertToMatrixRep(m,GF(2));;
gap> m[1][1] := Z(4);
Error, You cannot convert a locked vector compressed over GF(2) to GF(4)
