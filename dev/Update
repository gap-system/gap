%%  This file is intended to list the changes that will be published with
%%  the next update of GAP.
%%  The information is used for producing the announcement of the update,
%%  the additions to `tst/bugfix.tst', and an HTML page that lists the
%%  known bugs and intended new features.
%%
%%  For adding a change, just copy one of the templates below to the end of the
%%  file, and enter the relevant information.
%%
%%  Formal rules for this file, to allow simple parsing by a script:
%%          - lines starting with `%' are comments and are ignored
%%          - lines starting with `!' describe the type of information
%%            in the following lines until the next `!'-line
%%          - each entry must be finished with an `! End' line, otherwise
%%            the order of entries is irrelevant
%%          - the text behind the `!' is case and whitespace insensitive
%%

Fix: crash
Fix: wrong result
New: extended functionality
! Description
The semidirect product method for pcgs computable groups sometimes tried to use 
finite presentations which weren't polycyclic. This usually happens when the
groups are not pc groups. The risk for a wrong result is very low.
! Test Code
gap> G:=AlternatingGroup(4);;
gap> N:=Subgroup(G,[(1,2)(3,4),(1,3)(2,4)]);;
gap> H:=DirectProduct(CyclicGroup(2),CyclicGroup(2));;
gap> A:=AutomorphismGroup(H);;
gap> P:=SylowSubgroup(A,3);;
gap> epi:=NaturalHomomorphismByNormalSubgroup(G,N);;
gap> iso:=IsomorphismGroups(FactorGroup(G,N),P);;
gap> f:=CompositionMapping(IsomorphismGroups(FactorGroup(G,N),P),epi);;
gap> SemidirectProduct(G,f,H);

Fix: missing error handling
! Description
With newer gcc versions the option -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 is enabled by -Wall.
This reveals that the return value of system 'write' commands was not
checked in the GAP kernel. It is checked now and in case of an error a message
is printed.
