#
#  This script can be used together with `git bisect run` to track down
#  regressions. In a nutshell, `git bisect` performs a binary search on a
#  range of commits to find the one which introduced a change in behavior
#  (when branches and merge commits are involved, things are considerably more
#  complicated; for further information, please read `git help bisect`).
#
#  To use this script, you need a .tst file that tests the regression.
#  Moreover, you need to know at least one commit in which the bug is not
#  (yet) present, and one where it is present. Finally, you must make
#  a copy of this script, preferably outside the GAP directory. For example,
#  copy it to /tmp/gap-bisect.sh.
#
#  Then, execute the following commands from the GAP root directory; note that
#  the last command will usually checkout a different commit, so make sure
#  you have a clean working tree.
#       git bisect start
#       git bisect bad KNOWN-BAD-COMMIT
#       git bisect good KNOWN-GOOD-COMMIT
#
#  Now you normally need to test the commit selected by `git bisect` and then
#  report whether it is "good" or "bad". This is where this script comes in:
#  it can automate this for you using a .tst file, which means that you can
#  drink a coffee while it does the bisecting work for you. To use it, issue
#  the following command next:
#
#       git bisect run /PATH/TO/COPY/OF/bisect.sh YOUR_TEST_FILE.tst
#
#  Then git will start to check out revisions, and run this script, which in
#  turn compiles GAP, and then runs the test file given to it; depending on
#  the outcome of the test, the current commit is marked as bad or good, and
#  so on, until the commit introducing the change is found.
#
#  Some usage hints and caveats:
#
#  For a known bad commit, typically you will use `master`, but sometimes also
#  `stable-4.XYZ` may be useful.
#
#  For a known good commit, you can typically try to use `stable-4.X` for the
#  last major GAP release in which the regression was not yet present.
#
#  This script has to rebuild GAP in each iteration. This may involve
#  re-running the `configure` script. Beware: if you used `configure` options
#  that are not supported by older versions of the script, or changed
#  semantics, this can cause the build to fail. It is thus safest to use this
#  script after running `configure` with no options given.
#
#  When tracking down very old issues, it may be necessary to test versions of
#  GAP before 4.9. But between 4.8 and 4.9, we changed our build system, and
#  merged HPC-GAP. These changes complicate the bisecting process. Therefore
#  it is usually best to first determine if the issue was introduced before or
#  after these changes. Two tags were made on suitable commits before and
#  after these changes. So typically, you will first check if
#  bisect-before-hpcgap-merge is good (by checking it out, and running this
#  script). Depending on the outcome, mark it either as good via `git bisect
#  good`, and then proceed as above; or else mark it as bad, then proceed to
#  test bisect-before-hpcgap-merge (some more hints on that below).
#
#  For reference, here are the commit hashes to which the tags refer:
#
#  a5cb6b00726281d5310b89e5c4088fb62aa8d9d0  bisect-before-hpcgap-merge
#  c30acd6be350871560bd2efbff3af01f642a9fb6  bisect-after-new-buildsys
#
#  Note that when switching from testing commits using the "new" build system
#  to those using the old build system, you may need to perform some manual
#  cleanup to remove build artifacts that conflict between the two build
#  systems. At the very least, you should remove `GNUmakefile`. One option is
#  to use `git clean`, but beware that this may remove files you want to keep.
#  So I recommend to first run it in "dry mode" to just get a list of things
#  it would remove:
#
#      git clean -ndx -e pkg   # keep pkg dir
#
#  You can then identify files you want to keep and add more `-e PATTERN`
#  arguments. Once you are satisfied, run it in "force" mode to actually
#  delete the file, by changing `-ndx` to `-fdx`. Alternatively you can of
#  course also manually remove files.
#
#  Afterwards, I recommend to re-run `configure` manually, once. If you have
#  GMP installed system wide, you should run `./configure --with-gmp=system`.
#  Otherwise, GAP will compile its own copy of GMP, which can waste quite a
#  bit of time.
