@Descr
Recently someone asked for the computation of unit groups in group
rings.
<P>
For the case of group rings of p-groups over GF(p),
the standalone `sisyphos' by Martin Wursthorn provided some
facilities in this area.
(There was an interface from GAP 3 to this standalone, but this
did not cover the group ring functions of `sisyphos'.)
It would be good to have the respective algorithms in GAP 4.
Proceeding in the spirit of `sisyphos' would probably require
a new representation of group ring elements, via a Jennings basis.

<P>
The necessary theory is written down in the `sisyphos' manual
which is available in the GAP 3 share package,
and (besides Matrin Wursthorn's thesis) at least in one paper
of Martin, namely in JSC 15, 211-227, 1993.

<P> 
Remark by Alexander Konovalov (June 2004): advanced computations with 
units of modular group algebras of finite p-groups, based on the
mentioned ideas, are available now with the LAGUNA package 
(http://ukrgap.exponenta.ru/laguna.htm), firstly released in 2003.
