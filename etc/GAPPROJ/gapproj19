Finitely presented algebras
@Descr
<P>
The module enumerator is used as part of solvable- or hybrid quotient
algorithms. It produces the matrix action of a finitely presented algebra on
a finitely presented module.
</P>

<P>
This is a time-critical task that requires a good implementation.
</P>

<P>
It also would be useful to see, whether one can use if the algebra has in
fact a normal form for elements (this is the case in the quotient
algorithms).
</P>

<P>
A groebner basis approach might also be useful.

There is a basic GAP implementation
