@Descr
<P>
There are applications of combinatorial objects in GAP which quickly lead to
memory problems. In a certain range of problem size the main difficulty is that
one wants to loop over certain objects (subsets of a set, partitions of a
number, ...) and that the list of these objects needs too much memory (while
loop lengths of several billions may not be a problem with todays fast
computers). The
solution is to use iterators which allow to produce one object of the list
after the other without creating a list of all objects.
</P>

<P>
There are also problems where a numbering of a set of certain objects is
useful. In some cases one can construct enumerators which behave like a list
of objects, but which need only little memory.
</P>

<P>
It would be nice to have many interesting sets or lists of combinatorial 
objects available as efficiently implemented iterators and/or enumerators 
in GAP. (For example, currently one can loop over many types of groups
without generating a list of all elements.) 
</P>

<P>
The mathematical and programming difficulty of 
implementing iterators and enumerators (they are probably
often more difficult) will vary a lot between different kinds of objects.

@Manual
see Sections on Iterators and Enumerators and study the (too few) examples
in the current library.
@Ref
depends on the considered objects
