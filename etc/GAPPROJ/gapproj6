@Descr
If for example a group knows not to be nilpotent at present it tells
that it does not know whether it is abelian or cyclic. Of course it
could know that it is not abelian and not cyclic. Also if that group
is in fact a subgroup of another one it does not know if it is central
in the bigger group which again of course it could know.

<P>
The general problem is that certain properties imply others but that
having not a certain property does not imply anything in the other
direction.

<P>
We noticed this by looking at the information menus for subgroups in
XGAP, where for the user it looks of course rather silly to read
