@Descr
Threads would provide a way to run several calculations in one GAP in
parallel.  This can be used for example for:
<UL>
<LI>
Class identification in permutation groups: The first conjugacy test
which worked stops the calculation.
<LI>
FpGroups: TC and KB in parallel to see whether one succeeds.
<LI> ... many more
</UL>
However introducing this to the language would be a major endeavour.  It
also is not clear whether all library functions are reentrant. In particular
data structures in objects (such as stabilizer chains) might have to be
duplicated.

This will require a rewrite of the garbage collector
