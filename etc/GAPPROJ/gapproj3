Tables of Marks
@Descr
<P>
Currently we cannot state that the library of Tables of Marks in GAP 4
contains the Tables of Marks of all nonabelian simple groups until McL
(page 100 in the ATLAS),
but ``the only'' missing groups are L3(13), S4(7), U3(13), and several
L2(q).
It would be good if these tables could be added.
As for the L2(q) case, the best solution would be a generic table of
marks (along the lines of the description of the subgroups of PSL(2,q)
for example in Huppert's book).
</P>

<P>
Another candidate for the computation of the table of marks is the
sporadic simple O'Nan group.
As its maximal subgroups are comparatively small, this should be not
too difficult with the methods developed by G&ouml;tz Pfeiffer and Thomas
Merkwitz.
(Already 9 or 10 years ago, the computation of possible permutation
characters of the O'Nan group from the character table was surprisingly
easy.)
</P>

<P>
The project to extend the library of Tables of Marks would be a chance
to translate the GAP 3 code for the interactive construction of tables of
marks (written by G&ouml;tz and Thomas) to GAP 4.
