# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_CHECK_LIBRARY(VARIABLE-PREFIX, HEADER-FILE, LIBRARY-FILE, FUNCTION,
#                    [ACTION-IF-FOUND], [ACTION-IF-NOT_FOUND], [other-libraries])
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   Provides a generic test for a given library, similar in concept to the
#   PKG_CHECK_MODULES macro used by pkg-config.
#
#   Most simple libraries can be checked against simply through the
#   presence of a header file and a library to link to. This macro allows to
#   wrap around the test so that it doesn't have to be recreated each time.
#
#   Rather than define --with-$LIBRARY arguments, it uses variables in the
#   same way that PKG_CHECK_MODULES does. It doesn't, though, use the same
#   names, since you shouldn't provide a value for LIBS or CFLAGS but rather
#   for LDFLAGS and CPPFLAGS, to tell the linker and compiler where to find
#   libraries and headers respectively.
#
#   If the library is found, HAVE_PREFIX is defined, and in all cases
#   PREFIX_LDFLAGS and PREFIX_CPPFLAGS are substituted.
#
#   Example:
#
#     AX_CHECK_LIBRARY([LIBEVENT], [event.h], [event], [main], [],
#                      [AC_MSG_ERROR([Unable to find libevent])])
