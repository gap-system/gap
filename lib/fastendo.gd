#A  TransformationRepresentation(<obj>)
##
##  This is the transformation representation of the endo general mapping 
##  <obj>. Note, it is still a general mapping, not a transformation,
##  however, composition, equality and \< are all *much* faster.
##
##  Finding the TransformationRepresentation requires a call to 
##  EnumeratorSorted for the Source of the mapping (the set on which
##  it acts). This could be very expensive.
