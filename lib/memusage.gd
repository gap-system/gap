##
##  <Description>
##  Returns the amount of memory in bytes used by the object <A>obj</A>
##  and its subobjects. Note that in general, objects can reference
##  each other in very difficult ways such that determining the memory
##  usage is a recursive procedure. In particular, computing the memory
##  usage of a complicated structure itself uses some additional memory,
##  which is however no longer used after completion of this operation.
##  This procedure descends into lists and records, positional and
##  component objects; however it deliberately does not take into account
##  the type and family objects. For functions, it only takes the memory usage of
##  the function body, not of the local context the function was created
##  in, although the function keeps a reference to that as well.
