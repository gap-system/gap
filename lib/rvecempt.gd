##  This file contains the implementation of immutable empty row vectors.
##  An empty row vector is an immutable empty list whose family is
##  a collections family.
##  Empty row vectors are different if their families are different,
##  especially the ordinary empty list `[]' is different from every empty
##  row vector.
##
##  The first case where empty row vectors turned out to be necessary was
##  in the representation of elements of a zero dimensional s.c. algebra.
