# This file together with matobj1.gd formally define the interface to the 
# new style vectors and matrices in GAP.
# In this file all the operations, attributes and constructors are
# defined. It is read later in the GAP library reading process.
#

# TODO: make sure to document what exactly a new matrix obj implementation has to
# provide, and that we provide default implementations for everything else.


############################################################################
#
# Overview:
#
# <#GAPDoc Label="MatObj_Overview">
# The whole idea of this interface is that vectors and matrices must
# be proper objects with a stored type (i.e. created by Objectify allowing
# inheritance) to benefit from method selection. We therefore refer
# to the new style vectors and matrices as <Q>vector objects</Q> and
# <Q>matrix objects</Q> respectively. 
# <P/>It should be possible to write
# (efficient) code that is independent of the actual representation (in
# the sense of &GAP;'s representation filters) and preserves it.
# <P/>
# This latter requirement makes it necessary to distinguish between
# (at least) two classes of matrices:
# <List>
# <Item><Q>RowList</Q>-Matrices which behave basically like lists of rows,
#       in particular are the rows individual &GAP; objects that can
#       be shared between different matrix objects.</Item>
# <Item><Q>Flat</Q> matrices which behave basically like one &GAP; object
#       that cannot be split up further. In particular a row is only
#       a part of a matrix and no GAP object in itself.</Item>
# </List>
# For various reasons these two classes have to be distinguished
# already with respect to the definition of the operations for them.
# <P/>
# In particular vectors and matrices know their BaseDomain and their
# dimensions. Note that the basic condition is that the elements of
# vectors and matrices must either lie in the BaseDomain or naturally
# embed in the sense that + and * and = automatically work with all elements
# of the base domain (example: integers in polynomials over integers).
# <P/>
# Vectors are equal with respect to "=" if they have the same length
# and the same entries. It is not necessary that they have the same
# BaseDomain. Matrices are equal with respect to "=" if they have the
# same dimensions and the same entries. It is possible that not for all
# pairs of representations methods exist.
# <P/>
# It is not guaranteed that all rows of a matrix have the same vector type!
# It is for example thinkable that a matrix stores some of its rows in a
# sparse representation and some in a dense one!
# However, it is guaranteed that the rows of matrices in the same 
# representation are compatible in the sense that all vector operations
# defined in this interface can be applied to them and that new matrices
# in the same representation as the original matrix can be formed out of
# them.
# <P/>
# Note that there is neither a default mapping from the set of matrix 
# representations to the set of vector representations nor one in the 
# reverse direction! There is nothing like an "associated" vector
# representation to a matrix representation or vice versa.
# <P/>
# The way to write code that preserves the representation basically
# works by using constructing operations that take template objects
# to decide about the actual representation of the new object.
# <P/>
# Vectors do not have to be lists in the sense that they do not have
# to support all list operations. The same holds for matrices. However,
# RowList matrices behave nearly like lists of row vectors that insist
# on being dense and containing only vectors of the same length and
# with the same BaseDomain.
# <P/>
# There are some rules embedded in the comments to the following code.
# They are marked with the word "Rule". FIXME: Collect all rules here.
# <P/>

#   useful to be able to just try and invert it, and do something else if that "fail"s
#   But it is cheap to verify that a matrix is non-square, so why not error for that?
#   Same for One, ...

#
# An exception are properties:
