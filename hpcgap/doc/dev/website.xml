<Chapter Label="Chap-GAPWeb">
<Heading>Maintaining the &GAP; website</Heading>

This chapter describes how the information accessible on 
<URL Text="www.gap-system.org">http://www.gap-system.org/</URL> is stored 
and collected, and how it is transformed into web pages.

<Section Label="WPOverview">
<Heading>Overview</Heading>

The &GAP; website (in the following just called <Q>website</Q>) has 
a tree structure for easier navigation and overview. Each node and each
leaf of the tree is a web page. Every single page 
resides somewhere in this tree. This position is shown in the
navigation bar on the left hand side, and the user can navigate through
the tree using this navigation bar. However, pages can still link to other
pages that reside in some other branch of the tree. 

<P/>
With very few exceptions, all pages are static HTML pages conforming to
the XHTML 1.0 standard (see Section <Ref Sect="WPXHTML"/>). However, these
pages are not edited directly by the maintainer, but they are produced
by a tool called <Q>the <Package>Mixer</Package></Q> (see <Ref
Sect="WPMixer"/>), which takes so called <Q><F>.mixer</F>-files</Q>
as source and produces the final HTML files. During this process,
the navigation bar and some other parts of the page are created
automatically, such that the maintainer does not have to worry about
technicalities. A <F>.mixer</F> file essentially contains the content of
the page in form of a well-formed XML document (see again Section <Ref
Sect="WPXHTML"/> for an explanation) and the <Package>Mixer</Package> 
handles the technical details.

<P/>
All the sources for the web pages are kept in the Mercurial repository
<C>ssh://hg@hg.gap-system.org/GapWWW</C> in St Andrews. Everybody having 
access should be able to clone this repository using

<Verb>
hg clone ssh://hg@hg.gap-system.org/GapWWW 
</Verb>

The web server in St Andrews also uses its clone, updates it to the latest
revision of the &default; branch, runs the <Package>Mixer</Package> and then 
serves the pages. Another named branch is called &testing; and it is served
on the password protected version of the &GAP; website at 
<URL>http://devel.gap-system.org/testsite</URL> where work in progress may
be published to be reviewed internally.

<P/>
The &GAP; website has some pages that are treated specially such as
the &GAP; manuals, the pages for the &GAP; packages, the pages
providing search facilities, the pages for the &GAP; bibliography, the
sitemap, and the (old) &GAP; forum archive. The setup for these special
pages is described in Sections <Ref Sect="WPManuals"/> to 
<Ref Sect="WPForum"/> in this chapter.

<P/>
In the following sections we first cover the <Package>Mixer</Package>, the 
web standard XHTML 1.0, the usage of Mercurial for the web pages, and the
installation of the web site on the web server.
</Section>


<Section Label="WPStart">
<Heading>Getting started</Heading>

There are several possible workflows dependently on how much efforts
you would like to commit to the website maintenance.
<P/>

A minimalistic scenario for small improvements (e.g. correcting details 
and fixing typos) only requires to install 
<URL Text="Mercurial">http://mercurial.selenic.com/</URL> and then:
<Enum>
<Item>
Clone the Website repository: <C>hg clone ssh://hg@hg.gap-system.org/GapWWW</C>
</Item>
<Item>
Make changes in the &default; branch 
</Item>
<Item>
Commit and push changes to trigger notification to website admininstrator(s) 
to check and approve this update.
</Item>
</Enum>

A more robust scenario, especially for changes that are more likely to 
break the <Package>Mixer</Package> syntax, is to clone also the 
<Package>Mixer</Package> repository with

<Verb>
hg clone ssh://hg@hg.gap-system.org/Mixer
</Verb>

an build the <Package>Mixer</Package> as described in the <F>mixer.README</F> 
file (see Section <Ref Sect="WPMixer"/> for further details). For this step, 
you will need a C compiler (for compiling parts of the <Package>Mixer</Package>) 
and a <URL Text="Python">http://www.python.org/</URL> interpreter (for 
running the <Package>Mixer</Package>). 
<P/>

With <Package>Mixer</Package>, you may run the <F>mixer.py</F> script 
(probably with <C>-f</C> option to rebuild everything regardless the 
timestamps) inside the <F>GapWWW</F> working directory to check how 
produced html pages look like in your browser before committing and 
pushing the changes. 
<P/>

Finally, while changes in the &default; branches will trigger notification 
to website admininstrator(s) to check and approve them, for changes that 
you want to be internally reviewed prior to publication, you may use the 
&testing; branch which is served on the password protected version of the 
&GAP; website at <URL>http://devel.gap-system.org/testsite</URL>. Changes
in the &testing; branch will appear at the testing site immediately after
pushing them to the master repository. This workflow is useful if you want
to show your suggestions to a wider group of people who may not have an
opportunity to install <Package>Mixer</Package> and have a local version
of the &GAP; website to review your changes.
<P/>

If you are one of website admininstrator(s), then you will also need to
be able to access the web server in St Andrews via <C>ssh</C> to run 
certain update scripts and copy necessary data. 
</Section>


<Section Label="WPMixer">
<Heading>The Mixer</Heading>

The <Package>Mixer</Package> is a Python script that uses a C-library to
parse XML documents (see Section <Ref Sect="WPXHTML"/>). Therefore this
library (which comes with the <Package>Mixer</Package>) has to be compiled
first.

<P/>
The <Package>Mixer</Package> is kept in the Mercurial repository 
<C>ssh://hg@hg.gap-system.org/Mixer</C> in St Andrews. To clone this
repository, use

<Verb>
hg clone ssh://hg@hg.gap-system.org/Mixer
</Verb>

assuming that you already have access.

<P/>
The above command creates a clone of this repository in the directory 
<F>Mixer</F> of the current directory.
In that directory you can create the manual of the <Package>Mixer</Package>
by calling <C>make mixer.pdf</C> provided you have an installation of
&LaTeX; on your machine. In that manual the <Package>Mixer</Package> and
its installation are described in details.

<P/>
Alternatively you can download a copy of the <Package>Mixer</Package>
and its documentation
from 
<URL Text="this page">
http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~Max.Neunhoeffer/Computer/Software/mixer.html
</URL>.

<P/>
A small comment on the rationale behind the <Package>Mixer</Package> might
be in order. The fact that the input of the <Package>Mixer</Package>,
that is the <F>.mixer</F>-files have to be well-formed XML documents
(see Section <Ref Sect="WPXHTML"/>) might at first sight be considered
inconvenient and a bit awkward. However, this fact greatly improves the
chances that the resulting HTML files conform to the XHTML 1.0 standard
and at the same time lead to the fact that the <Package>Mixer</Package>
is able to give very concise and usable error message during parsing
in case something is not well-formed. This together with the automatically
generated navigation bar makes the <Package>Mixer</Package> a valuable tool
for the creation of web pages.

<P/>
Note in particular that the tree structure of the whole web site is
controlled by the <F>tree</F> files in each subdirectory, exactly as
described in the manual of the <Package>Mixer</Package>.

</Section>

<Section Label="WPXHTML">
<Heading>XHTML</Heading>

The HTML language has undergone a series of revision and standardizations.
One major step was to make an HTML standard that conforms to the XML
standard which happened with the revision <Q>XHTML 1.0</Q> of the
HTML standard. This step was important because the XML framework
makes it much easier to parse such documents automatically and check
for <Q>well-formedness</Q>. Here, the term <Q>well-formed</Q> means
that the document fulfils a set of syntactic rules. That is, a document
might be well-formed and at the same time not make any sense.
See <URL Text="this page">http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/</URL> for details.
A short introduction to the XML standard can be found in
Section <Ref Sect="XML" BookName="GAPDoc"/>  in the &GAPDoc; manual.
<P/>

The &GAP; web pages should conform to the standard XHTML 1.0.
To cut a long story short, this means a few restrictions on the markup
to use. Here we quickly cover the most important things, which should
enable anybody who has ever seen an HTML document of any version
to get started.

<Enum>
<Item>
All tags must be written with lower case letters in the element names.
</Item>
<Item>
All non-empty elements must have a start- and end-tag, in particular
enclose paragraphs in <C>&lt;p&gt;</C> and <C>&lt;/p&gt;</C> or list 
entries in <C>&lt;li&gt;</C> and <C>&lt;/li&gt;</C>.
</Item>
<Item>
Elements must be properly nested like brackets, that is things like
<C>&lt;a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</C> are not allowed.
</Item>
<Item>
Attributes always must have an assigned value and the value must be
enclosed by either double or single quotes; for example
<C>&lt;a href="http://www.gap-system.org"&gt;GAP site&lt;/a&gt;</C>.
</Item>
<Item> Write empty elements like <C>&lt;br /&gt;</C>, the space before the
<C>/</C> is not necessary according to the specification but it helps
some old browsers to interpret it correctly.
</Item>
<Item> Do not put information on colors or fonts in the XHTML file. Instead
use the <C>.css</C> style sheet file. (For complicated cases use the
<C>class</C> attribute to mark elements for which you want to give special
formating rules in the style sheet.
</Item>
<Item> The XML markup characters <Q><C>&lt;</C></Q>, <Q><C>&amp;</C></Q>, and 
    <Q><C>&gt;</C></Q>
    must be entered as <Q><C>&amp;lt;</C></Q>, <Q><C>&amp;amp;</C></Q>, 
    and <Q><C>&amp;gt;</C></Q>
    respectively. There are quite a few such <Q>entities</Q> which are
    defined to enter special characters. See
    <URL Text="this page">http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/Overview.html#h-A2</URL>
    for details.
</Item>
</Enum>

Using the <URL Text="W3C">http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/</URL> 
specification
<URL Text="HTML 4.01">http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/</URL> - this includes 
a nice <E>elements</E> overview - together with the above rules and 
the general rule to avoid complicated looking constructs when possible,
we found it not too difficult to produce sets of valid web pages.


</Section>

<Section Label="WPHG">
<Heading>Mercurial usage</Heading>

We assume here that you are familiar with the standard Mercurial commands
<C>hg clone</C>, <C>hg pull</C>, <C>hg push</C>, <C>hg update</C>,
<C>hg commit</C> etc.
<P/>

The source files for the web site are kept in the Mercurial repository
<C>ssh://hg@hg.gap-system.org/GapWWW</C> in St Andrews. Assuming that 
you already have access, you may clone it by doing

<Verb>
hg clone ssh://hg@hg.gap-system.org/GapWWW 
</Verb>

This command creates in your current directory a directory <F>GapWWW</F>
with the complete source tree of the web site.
<P/>

Source files are treated like any other source file in the Mercurial repository,
that is you can update, modify, commit, add, remove them as usual.
<P/>

The only thing one has to understand with respect to Mercurial is which 
implications the branch in which the change has appeared will have on the
process of its publication:
<List>
<Item>
Changes in the &default; branch will not be automatically published on
the web server. They will be reviewed by the website administrator who
will then have to run the update script on the server in St Andrews as 
described in Section <Ref Sect="WPyin"/> to make them available online.
</Item>
<Item>
Changes in the &testing; branch will immediately appear on the password 
protected version of the &GAP; website at 
<URL>http://devel.gap-system.org/testsite</URL> where they may be reviewed
by others.
</Item>
<Item>
Changes in feature branches (which you may create to keep some
work in progress) will not be visible anywhere.
</Item>
</List>
<P/>

A little comment on the rationale behind this setup might be in order.
It allows that more than one person works independently on the
website and those people exchange versions via Mercurial, without 
publishing them immediately. The actual guidelines who does what 
in this process should be agreed on separately.
<P/>

</Section>

<Section Label="WPyin">
    <Heading>The web server in St Andrews</Heading>

Currently, the actually published version of the web site is contained in 
the directory <F>/gap/GapWWW</F> on the following machine in St Andrews:
<Verb>
    yin.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk
</Verb>
This machine is not really a web server, but the real web server mounts
and serves the directory <F>/gap/GapWWW</F> from <F>yin</F> via NFS.
<P/>

The <Package>Mixer</Package> is checked out (still old CVS version, it has 
not been changed since it remained unchanged over several years) and 
installed in the directory <F>/gap/Mixer</F>. It can be called with the command

<Verb>
    /gap/Mixer/mixer.py
</Verb>

<P/>
The files are checked out with ownership <F>gapchron</F> which is a
user on <F>yin</F> with the same numerical user ID than the <F>gap</F>
user. In other words, one has to be the user <F>gap</F> to manipulate
the data. Note that the home directory of the user <F>gap</F> is in fact
<F>/gap</F>.

<P/>
To get access to this data the easiest and most secure way is probably
to create an RSA key pair, append the public key to
<F>/gap/.ssh/authorized_keys</F> and to keep the private key in the
<F>.ssh</F> subdirectory of the user's home directory.

<P/>
There is one shell script which is run by a website administrator to 
update the website. This script is in <F>bin/updateGapWWW.sh</F>.
It basically pulls the latest version from the master repository 
and runs the <Package>Mixer</Package>. You can trigger the update manually
by doing

<Verb>
   ssh gap@yin.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk bin/updateGapWWW.sh
</Verb>

once you have <C>ssh</C> access to <F>yin</F>.

<P/>
Before performing an update on <F>yin</F>, it is wise to check first 
whether the <Package>Mixer</Package> runs without
an error message in your own checked out version of the website.

</Section>

<Section Label="WPInstall">
<Heading>Installation on the web server</Heading>

This section describes the procedure to install the &GAP; web site on
a machine from scratch. Thus, this section is usually not needed 
because all this is already done on the machine
<F>yin.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk</F>. However, if one wants to have an exact
copy of the web site or have to install it somewhere anew, this
section is needed. This section was derived from the ASCII document
<F>GapWWW/INSTALL</F> long time ago when it was under CVS control 
(so <F>GapWWW/INSTALL</F> is likely heavily outdated).

<Subsection>
<Heading>Needed ingredients</Heading>

<List>
<Item>
  standard tools: <C>hg</C>, <C>tar</C>, <C>gzip</C>, <C>make</C>, <C>sh</C>

<Item>
  a C-compiler, preferably <C>gcc</C>
</Item>
<Item>
  <Package>Python</Package> version 2.2 or later (for running the

</Subsection>

<Subsection>
<Heading>Installation procedure</Heading>

<Enum>
<Item>
Clone the Mercurial repository GapWWW:

<Verb>
hg clone ssh://hg@hg.gap-system.org/GapWWW 
</Verb>
            
This creates a subdirectory <F>GapWWW</F> in the current directory.
</Item>

<Item>
Clone the Mercurial repository Mixer:

<Verb>
hg clone ssh://hg@hg.gap-system.org/Mixer
</Verb>

This creates a subdirectory <F>Mixer</F> in the current directory.
</Item>

<Item>
Unpack some (frozen) subtrees, which are in archives:

<Verb>
    cd GapWWW  
    gzip -dc ForumArchive.tar.gz | tar xvf -
    cd Gap3  
    gzip -dc Manual3.tar.gz | tar xvf -
    cd ..    
</Verb>

</Item>      

<Item>
Edit <F>GapWWW/lib/config</F>, see that file for instructions:

<Verb>
    vi lib/config
</Verb>
             
    In this file a few variables have to be defined to adapt the web pages
    to the local conditions.
</Item>

<Item>
Copy a whole <F>doc</F> directory of a &GAP; distribution to the place 
mentioned in <F>GapWWW/lib/config</F> (see step 4.) in the variable
<C>GAPManualLink</C> (this is <F>GapWWW/Manuals</F> in the current setup).
</Item>

<Item>
The files for the &GAP; bibliography have been included into this directory
tree in the repository.
             
<P/>
Create the html and PDF versions by:
             
<Verb>
    cd Doc/Bib
    gap4 convbib.g
    cd ../.. 
</Verb>
             
Some more information about this is in <F>GapWWW/Doc/Bib/INFO</F>
which is unchanges since 2010 and may be somewhat outdated.
</Item>

<Item>
Install search facility:
             
<P/>
    Things are in <F>GapWWW/Search</F>. You need the <C>swish</C> utility 
    installed to create the index files for searching. Create a link in
the <F>Search</F> directory to the swish executable.
    Then create index files by:
             
<Verb>
    cd Search
    ln -s PATHTOSWISH swish
    make
    cd ..
</Verb>

(<F>PATHTOSWISH</F> has to be replaced by the path to the swish executable.)

<P/>
The CGI script <F>GapWWW/Search/search.cgi</F> will take care of the rest.
</Item>

<Item>
Install package manuals:

<P/>
    Copy the result of Frank's scripts to the place mentioned in 
    <F>GapWWW/lib/config</F> (in the variable <F>pkgmixerpath</F>).
    (currently, this is <F>GapWWW/Manuals</F>, copy the whole <F>pkg</F> 
    directory)

<P/>
    To update the package pages, copy all <F>.mixer</F> files and 
    <F>pkgconf.py</F> to <F>GapWWW/Packages</F> and rerun the 
    <Package>Mixer</Package>.
</Item>

<Item>
Make sure that the file  
       <F>GapWWW/lib/AllLinksOfAllHelpSections.data</F> is always up-to-date
     (this has to be adjusted whenever the released manuals change).

<P/>
     In the development version of &GAP; there is a file 
     <F>dev/LinksOfAllHelpSections.g</F>.
     Read this with a current &GAP; version with all currently released
     packages installed and call <C>WriteAllLinksOfAllHelpSections()</C>, 
     this writes the file <F>AllLinksOfAllHelpSections.data</F>. It has
     then to be checked in to its place under the <F>GapWWW</F> tree.
     Do not forget to publish the latest revision.
</Item>

<Item>
Run the mixer:

<Verb>
    ../Mixer/mixer.py -f
</Verb>
    (the <C>-f</C> forces creation regardless of timestamps)
</Item>
</Enum>

</Subsection>

<Subsection>
<Heading> Installing updated versions </Heading>

If things are changed in the repository, all that has to be done to update the
pages locally is:

<Verb>
hg pull
hg up
</Verb>

in the <F>GapWWW</F> directory, followed by a
             
<Verb>
  ../Mixer/mixer.py
</Verb>

The mixer has an option <C>-f</C> to force recreation of all pages. This is
necessary if some general files like the address database
<F>lib/addresses</F> or templates changes.

<P/>
To change the sitemap, use <Package>yEd</Package> graph editor to modify 
<F>sitemap.graphml</F> file, then used <Package>yEd</Package> export
menu to create <F>sitemap.html</F> file with associated <F>.png</F>
image.
</Subsection>

</Section>

<Section Label="WPManuals">
<Heading>The &GAP; manuals on the web pages</Heading>

All &GAP; manuals are available in HTML format via the web pages. This
works by simply copying the <F>doc</F> directory of a complete &GAP;
installation to the place specified by the variable <F>GAPManualLink</F>
in <F>GapWWW/lib/config</F> (which is <F>GapWWW/Manuals</F> in the current
setup). Note that those files are <E>not</E>
under version control there, they are only copied to checked out
working copies, like for example on the web server in St Andrews.

<P/>
The single remaining point to explain is how one can specify links
to manual sections on the web pages. This is done with a special
<Package>Mixer</Package> tag like the following:

<Verb>
    &lt;mixer manual="Reference: Lists"&gt;Chapter about lists&lt;/mixer&gt;
</Verb>

This element creates a link to the manual section which would appear
in the &GAP; help system when called with <Q><C>?Reference: Lists</C></Q>, which
happens to be the chapter in the reference manual about lists. The
text of the link would be <Q>Chapter about lists</Q>.

<P/>
This works, because the <Package>Mixer</Package> has access to a file
containing the links to all manual sections. This file resides in
<F>GapWWW/lib/AllLinksOfAllHelpSections.data</F>, which is created
using <F>dev/LinksOfAllHelpSections.g</F> in the development version
of &GAP; as described in Section <Ref Sect="WPInstall"/>.

<P/>
The value of the attribute <Q>manual</Q> in the <Q>mixer</Q> tag
must be the complete text of the section heading the link should
point to.
</Section>

<Section Label="WPPackages">
<Heading>The &GAP; packages on the web pages</Heading>

The archives and web pages for the &GAP; packages are generated
by yet another set of tools described in Chapter <Ref Chap="Chap-PkgDist"/>. 
These generate for every package a <F>.mixer</F>-file and for all packages
together a file <F>pkgconf.py</F>. All these files have to be put
under version control in the directory <F>GapWWW/Packages</F>. These nodes then only
have to be put into the tree by mentioning them in the <F>tree</F> file
there.

</Section>

<Section Label="WPSearch">
<Heading>The search engine on the web pages</Heading>

The search engine on the web pages internally uses the <C>swish</C> tool.
It is used to create an index of all pages which allows very fast
searches when a user submits a query. All files for this setup are in
the directory <F>GapWWW/Search</F>.

<P/>
The indices are regenerated by doing

<Verb>
    touch everything.conf
    make
</Verb>

in that directory. This is done automatically every night, such that 
usually nothing has to be done after installation.

<P/>
To make this work, one needs a <C>swish</C> executable and has to create
a link <F>GapWWW/Search/swish</F> to that executable.

</Section>

<Section Label="WPBiblio">
<Heading>The &GAP; bibliography</Heading>

The &GAP; bibliography resides in the directory <F>GapWWW/Doc/Bib</F>.

<P/>
The source files are:

<List>
    <Mark> <F>GapCite.MR</F> </Mark>
    <Item> This file contains just MR numbers of papers that cite or refer 
    to (one of the versions of) GAP (here and below <Q>MR</Q> stands for 
    <Q>Mathematical Reviews</Q>.). The format is alternatingly one line 
    of the form <C>1stAuthorSurname Paper</C> (not starting with a blank) and
    one line <C>MR-Number</C> (starting with a blank). MR numbers will be used
    to get full bibliographic info from MathSciNet, and the textual description
    only helps when adding papers to the file (in particular, to keep entries 
    sorted by the first author).
    </Item>
    <Mark> <F>GapCite.notyet</F> </Mark>
    <Item> <C>BiBTeX</C> entries for papers that are not yet in MR but
        likely will be there in a few months </Item>
    <Mark> <F>GapNonMR.bib</F> </Mark>
    <Item> <C>BiBTeX</C> entries for papers that will not be in MR (e.g. 
           theses)
    </Item>
    <Mark> <F>NonVerif.MR</F> </Mark>
    <Item> Things not yet verified, same format as <F>GapCite.MR</F></Item>
    <Mark> <F>NonVerif.NonMR</F> </Mark>
    <Item> Things not yet verified, same format as <F>GapCite.notyet</F></Item>
    <Mark> <F>GapIgnore.MR</F> </Mark>
    <Item> This file contains a list of &GAP; strings corresponding to MR 
    numbers of papers that may be falsely reported by MathSciNet as citing
    &GAP; (for example, if they refer to the History of Mathematics Archive
    website wrongly stating its address in the &GAP; domain as may be returned
    by some search systems). If necessary, add new items there in an obvious
    way.
    </Item>
</List>

It is possible to check MathSciNet for new references to &GAP; reading the 
file <F>updatebib.g</F> into &GAP;. It will produce two files:

<List>
    <Mark> <F>tobeadded.txt</F> </Mark>
    <Item> This file has the same format as <F>GapCite.MR</F> and 
    lists publications citing &GAP; which should be examined and 
    after that added either to <F>GapCite.MR</F> or to <F>GapIgnore.MR</F>.
    </Item>
    <Mark> <F>suggested.txt</F> </Mark>
    <Item> This file contains suggestions to <Q>move</Q> certain entries
    from <F>GapCite.notyet</F> and <F>GapNonMR.bib</F> to <F>GapCite.MR</F>.
    All suggestions, including those which do not match the publication
    listed in the &GAP; bibliography, should be carefully examined before any
    changes.
    </Item>
</List>

Note that <F>updatebib.g</F> is not a complete solution for updating &GAP; 
bibliography. It searches for occurrences of the substring <C>www.gap</C>
in citations (this covers both old and current addresses of the &GAP; website), 
but it does not cover publications citing &GAP; without its website or referring
to it only in the text; finally, it covers only MathSciNet and does not look
into other bibliography databases. Therefore, manual search still should be 
used to discover more &GAP; citations. The function 
<C>SearchMathSciNetForUpdates</C> from <F>updatebib.g</F> may be helpful in
this direction since it performs more broad search in the MathSciNet, dropping
some more strict limitations.
<P/>

After the source files of the &GAP; bibliography are updated, the script 
<F>newmakegapbib</F> uses <F>GapCite.MR</F>, <F>GapCite.notyet</F> and 
<F>GapNonMR.bib</F> (and also <F>HEADER</F> and <F>MRBIB</F>) to
produce <F>gap-published.bib</F> (this requires subscription to MathSciNet, 
which St Andrews has). The advantage of this approach is that MathSciNet gives 
us good <C>BiBTeX</C> entries (no need to look up journal names or diacritic
characters) and their updates, and MR numbers we can link to. It also makes 
it easier to add entries as only the MR number is needed.
<P/>

At the end of its work <F>newmakegapbib</F> will also display error 
messages reporting MR numbers whose BibTeX record it failed to fetch from 
MathSciNet -- these should be investigated since they may point out on
some inconsistencies in our data.
<P/>

<P/>
(There is also a script <C>GETMR</C> that will return MR
numbers for papers -- convenient to look up a large number of papers one
found in the citation index.)

<P/>
Finally &GAP; itself called with <F>convbib.g</F> produces the web page
and a nice PDF bibliography from <F>gap-published.bib</F> (using further
helper files <F>gapbib.tex</F> and <F>gap-head.bib</F>). The resulting
files are <F>gap-published.html</F> and <F>gap-published.pdf</F> which 
are linked from the main web page <F>bib.html</F>. <E>NOTE</E> that 
<F>gap-published.html</F> and <F>gap-published.pdf</F> are <E>not</E> under 
version control because they can be generated automatically by <F>convbib.g</F> rather 
quickly. In addition, <F>convbib.g</F> creates <F>statistics.generated</F>
and <F>statistics.mscreport</F> - two pages with tables which are used in 
<F>statistics.mixer</F> to create <F>statistics.html</F>.
<P/>

The output of <F>convbib.g</F> should be also checked for errors and warnings
reporting repeated entries, incomplete BibTeX records (mostly may be ignored), etc.
<P/>

<E>NOTE</E>: 
The current setup does not run &GAP; on <F>convbib.g</F>
every night. This means that everybody who changes the &GAP; bibliography
has to do this manually on <C>yin</C> after every change.

<Heading>The sitemap</Heading>

The sitemap picture is generated and edited in the following way: The
original source is the file <F>sitemap.graphml</F> which is generated and
edited with the <Package>yEd</Package> program. <Package>yEd</Package>
functionality allows to export the sitemap as a clickable HTML image map,
producing two files <F>sitemap.html</F> and <F>sitemap1_1.png</F>. Because 
the sitemap usually does not change very much, these two files are also
kept under the version control.

<Section Label="WPForum">
<Heading>The &GAP; forum archive</Heading>

Until December 2003 the &GAP; forum archive was handled by a tool written
especially for this task. At that point it was switched to <C>mailman</C>,
a generic tool for mailing list, which also does the archiving. 
Therefore the old forum archives are frozen in form of a huge amount
of HTML pages. These are not kept under version control as single files but as one big
binary archive under <F>GapWWW/ForumArchive.tar.gz</F>. 

<P/>
To install those pages in a checked out working copy one just has to 
extract this archive by doing

<Verb>
    gzip -dc ForumArchive.tar.gz | tar xf -
</Verb>

in the <F>GapWWW</F> directory as explained in Section <Ref Sect="WPInstall"/>.
