<Heading>Partial permutations</Heading>

This chapter describes the functions in &GAP; for partial permutations. 
<P/>

A <E>partial permutation</E> in &GAP; is simply an injective function from any
finite set of positive integers to any other finite set of positive integers.
The largest point on which a partial permutation can be defined, and the
largest value that the image of such a point can have, are defined by certain
architecture dependent limits. <P/>

Every inverse semigroup is isomorphic to an inverse semigroup of partial
permutations and, as such, partial permutations are to inverse semigroup theory
what permutations are to group theory and transformations are to semigroup
theory.  In this way, partial permutations are the
elements of inverse partial permutation semigroups.  <P/>

A partial permutations in &GAP; acts on a finite set of positive integers on
the right. The image of a point <C>i</C> under a partial permutation <C>f</C>
is expressed as <C>i^f</C> in &GAP;.  This action is also implemented by the
function <Ref Func="OnPoints"/>.  The preimage of a point <C>i</C> under the
partial permutation <C>f</C> can be computed using  <C>i/f</C> without
constructing the inverse of <C>f</C>.  Partial permutations in &GAP; are
created using the operations described in Section <Ref
  Sect="sect:CreatingPartialPerms"/>. 
Partial permutations are, by default, displayed
in component notation, which is described in Section 
<Ref Sect="sect:DisplayingPartialPerms"/>. <P/>

The fundamental attributes of a partial permutation are:
<List>
  <Mark>Domain</Mark>
  <Item>The <E>domain</E> of a partial permutation is just the set of positive
    integers where it is defined; see <Ref Attr="DomainOfPartialPerm"/>. We
    will denote the domain of a partial permutation <C>f</C> by dom(<C>f</C>).
  </Item>
  <Mark>Degree</Mark>
  <Item> The <E>degree</E> of a partial permutation <C>f</C> is just the largest
    positive integer where <C>f</C> is defined. In other words, the degree of
    <C>f</C> is the largest element in the domain of <C>f</C>; 
    see <Ref Attr="DegreeOfPartialPerm"/>. 
  </Item>
  <Mark>Image list</Mark>
  <Item>
    The <E>image list</E> of a partial permutation <C>f</C> is the list 
    <C>[i_1^f, i_2^f, .. , i_n^f]</C>
    where the domain of <C>f</C> is 
    <C>[i_1, i_2, .., i_n]</C>
    see <Ref Attr="ImageListOfPartialPerm"/>. For example, the partial perm 
    sending <C>1</C> to <C>5</C> and <C>2</C> to <C>4</C> has image list 
    <C>[ 5, 4 ]</C>.
  </Item>
  <Mark>Image set</Mark>
  <Item>
    The <E>image set</E> of a partial permutation <C>f</C> is just the set of
    points in the image list (i.e. the image list after it has been sorted into
    increasing order);
    see <Ref Attr="ImageSetOfPartialPerm"/>. We will denote the image set of a
    partial permutation <C>f</C> by im(<C>f</C>). 
  </Item>
  <Mark>Codegree</Mark>
  <Item> The <E>codegree</E> of a partial permutation <C>f</C> is just the
    largest positive integer of the form <C>i^f</C> for any <C>i</C>
    in the domain of <C>f</C>. In other words, the codegree of <C>f</C> is
    the largest element in the image of <C>f</C>; see 
    <Ref Attr="CodegreeOfPartialPerm"/>. 
  </Item>
 <Mark>Rank</Mark>
  <Item>The <E>rank</E> of a partial permutation <C>f</C> is the size of its
    domain, or equivalently the size of its image set or image list; see 
    <Ref Attr="RankOfPartialPerm"/>.
  </Item>
</List>

  A <E>functional digraph</E> is a directed graph where every vertex has
  out-degree <C>1</C>.  A partial permutation <A>f</A> can be thought of as a
  functional digraph with vertices <C>[1..DegreeOfPartialPerm(f)]</C> and 
  edges from <C>i</C> to <C>i^f</C> for every <C>i</C>. A <E>component</E>
  of a partial permutation is defined as a component of the corresponding
  functional digraph. 
  More specifically, <C>i</C> and <C>j</C> are in the same component if and
  only if there are <M>i=v_0, v_1, \ldots, v_n=j</M> such that either 
  <M>v_{k+1}=v_{k}^f</M> or <M>v_{k}=v_{k+1}^f</M> for all <C>k</C>. <P/>
  
  If <C>S</C> is a semigroup and <C>s</C> is an element of <C>S</C>, then an
  element <C>t</C> in <C>S</C> is a <E>semigroup inverse</E> for <C>s</C> if 
  <C>s*t*s=s</C> and <C>t*s*t=t</C>; see, for example,
  <Ref Oper="InverseOfTransformation"/>. A semigroup in which every element has
  a unique semigroup inverse is called an <E>inverse semigroup</E>.<P/> 

  Every partial permutation belongs to a symmetric inverse monoid; see 
  <Ref Func="SymmetricInverseSemigroup"/>. Inverse semigroups of partial
  permutations are hence inverse subsemigroups of the symmetric inverse
  monoids. <P/>

  The inverse <C>f^-1</C> of a partial permutation <C>f</C> is simply the
  partial permutation that maps <C>i^f</C> to <C>i</C> for all <C>i</C> in the
  image of <C>f</C>. It follows that the domain of <C>f^-1</C> equals the
  image of <C>f</C> and that the image of <C>f^-1</C> equals the domain of
  <C>f</C>.  The inverse <C>f^-1</C> is the
  unique partial permutation with the property that <C>f*f^-1*f=f</C>
  and <C>f^-1*f*f^-1=f^-1</C>. In other words, <C>f^-1</C> is the unique
  semigroup inverse of <C>f</C> in the symmetric inverse monoid. <P/>

  If <C>f</C> and <C>g</C> are partial permutations, then the domain and image
  of the product are:
  <Alt Only='Text'>
  <Display>
    dom(fg)=(im(f)\cap dom(g))f^-1 and
    im(fg)=(im(f)\cap dom(g))g
  </Display>
  </Alt>
  <Alt Not='Text'>
  <Display>
    \textrm{dom}(fg)=(\textrm{im}(f)\cap \textrm{dom}(g))f^{-1}\textrm{ and }
    \textrm{im}(fg)=(\textrm{im}(f)\cap \textrm{dom}(g))g
  </Display>
  </Alt>

  A partial permutation is an idempotent if and only if it is the identity 
  function on its domain.
  The products <C>f*f^-1</C> and <C>f^-1*f</C> are just the identity
  functions on the domain and image of <C>f</C>, respectively. It follows that
  <C>f*f^-1</C> is a left identity for <C>f</C> and <C>f^-1*f</C> is a right
  identity. These products will be referred to here 
  as the <E>left one</E> and <E>right one</E> of the partial permutation
  <C>f</C>; see <Ref Oper="LeftOne" Label="for a partial perm"/>.  The
  <E>one</E> of a partial permutation is just the identity on the
  union of its domain and its image, and the <E>zero</E> of a partial
  permutation is just the empty partial permutation; see 
  <Ref Oper="One" Label="for a partial perm"/> and
  <Ref Oper="MultiplicativeZero" Label="for a partial perm"/>.
  <P/>

  If <C>S</C> is an arbitrary inverse semigroup, the <E>natural partial
  order</E> on <C>S</C> is defined as follows: for elements <C>x</C> and
  <C>y</C> of <C>S</C> we say <C>x</C><M>\leq</M><C>y</C> if there exists an
  idempotent element <C>e</C> in <C>S</C> such that <C>x=ey</C>. 
  In the context of the symmetric inverse monoid, a partial permutation
  <C>f</C> is less than or equal to a partial permutation <C>g</C> in the
  natural partial order if and only
  if <C>f</C> is a restriction of <C>g</C>. The natural partial order is a meet
  semilattice, in other words, every pair of elements has a greatest lower
  bound; see <Ref Oper="MeetOfPartialPerms"/>.<P/> 

  Note that unlike permutations, partial permutations do not fix unspecified
  points but are simply undefined on such points; see Chapter 
  <Ref Chap="Permutations"/>. Similar to permutations, and unlike
  transformations, it is possible to multiply any two partial permutations in
  &GAP;.<P/>

  Internally, &GAP; stores a partial permutation <C>f</C> as a list consisting
  of the codegree of <C>f</C> and the images <C>i^f</C> of the points
  <C>i</C> that are less than or equal to the degree of <C>f</C>; the value
  <C>0</C> is stored where <C>i^f</C> is undefined.  The domain and image set
  of <C>f</C> are also stored after either of these values is computed. When
  the codegree of a partial permutation <C>f</C> is less than 65536, the
  codegree and images <C>i^f</C> are stored as 16-bit integers, the domain and
  image set are subobjects of <C>f</C>  which are immutable plain lists of
  &GAP; integers.  When the codegree of <C>f</C> is greater than or equal to
  65536, the codegree and images are stored as 32-bit integers; the domain and
  image set are stored in the same way as before. A partial permutation belongs
  to <C>IsPPerm2Rep</C> if it is stored using 16-bit integers  and to
  <C>IsPPerm4Rep</C> otherwise. 
<P/>

In the names of the &GAP; functions that deal with partial permutations, the word <Q>Permutation</Q> is usually abbreviated to <Q>Perm</Q>, to save typing. 
For example, the category test function for partial permutations is

<Section Label="sect:CreatingPartialPerms">
  <Heading>Creating partial permutations</Heading>

  There are several ways of creating partial permutations in &GAP;, which are 
  described in this section.  

<!-- *************************************************************** -->
  
  <ManSection>
    <Func Name="PartialPerm" Arg="dom, img" Label="for a domain and image"/>
    <Func Name="PartialPerm" Arg="list" Label="for a dense image"/>
    <Returns>A partial permutation.</Returns>
    <Description>
      Partial permutations can be created in two ways: by giving the domain
      and the image, or the dense image list.<P/>

      <List>
        <Mark>Domain and image</Mark>
        <Item>
          The partial permutation defined by a domain <A>dom</A> and image
          <A>img</A>, where <A>dom</A> is a set of positive integers and
          <A>img</A> is a duplicate free list of positive integers, maps
          <A>dom</A><C>[i]</C> to <A>img</A><C>[i]</C>. For example,
          the partial permutation mapping <C>1</C> and <C>5</C> to <C>20</C> and
          <C>2</C> can be created using: 
          <Log>PartialPerm([1,5],[20,2]); </Log>
          In this setting, <C>PartialPerm</C> is the analogue in the context of
          partial permutations of <Ref Func="MappingPermListList"/>. 
        </Item>
        <Mark>Dense image list</Mark>
        <Item>
          The partial permutation defined by a dense image list <A>list</A>,
          maps the positive integer <C>i</C> to <A>list</A><C>[i]</C> if
          <A>list</A><C>[i]&lt;>0</C> and is undefined at <C>i</C> if
          <A>list</A><C>[i]=0</C>.  For example, the partial permutation
          mapping <C>1</C> and <C>5</C> to <C>20</C> and <C>2</C> can be
          created using: <Log>PartialPerm([20,0,0,0,2]);</Log>
          In this setting, <C>PartialPerm</C> is the analogue in the context of
          partial permutations of <Ref Func="PermList"/>.
        </Item>
      </List>

      Regardless of which of these two methods are used to create a partial
      permutation in &GAP; the internal representation is the same. <P/>

      If the largest point in the domain is larger than the
      rank of the partial permutation, then using the dense image list to
      define the partial permutation will require less typing; otherwise
      using the domain and the image will require less typing. For example,
      the partial permutation mapping <C>10000</C> to <C>1</C> can be defined
      using:
      <Log>PartialPerm([10000], [1]);</Log>
      but using the dense image list would require a list with <C>9999</C>
      entries equal to <C>0</C> and the final entry equal to <C>1</C>. 
      On the other hand, the identity on <C>[1,2,3,4,6]</C> can be defined
      using:
      <Log>PartialPerm([1,2,3,4,0,6]);</Log>
      <P/>

      Please note that a partial permutation in &GAP; is never a permutation
      nor is a permutation ever a partial permutation. For example, the
      permutation <C>(1,4,2)</C> fixes <C>3</C> but the partial permutation
      <C>PartialPerm([4,1,0,2]);</C> is not defined on <C>3</C>.

    <Oper Name="PartialPermOpNC" Arg='obj, list[, func]'/>
    <Returns>A partial permutation or <K>fail</K>.</Returns>
    <Description>
      <Ref Oper="PartialPermOp"/> returns the partial permutation that corresponds
      to the action of the object <A>obj</A> on the domain or list <A>list</A>
      via the function <A>func</A>. If the optional third argument <A>func</A>
      is not specified, then the action <Ref Func="OnPoints"/> is used by
      default.  Note that the returned partial permutation
      refers to the positions in <A>list</A> even if <A>list</A> itself
      consists of integers.  <P/>
      
      This function is the analogue in the context of
      partial permutations of <Ref Func="Permutation" BookName="ref" 
        Label="for a group, an action domain, etc."/> or 
      <Ref Func="TransformationOp"/>.<P/>
      
      If <A>obj</A> does not map the elements of <A>list</A> injectively,
      then <K>fail</K> is returned.<P/>

      <Ref Oper="PartialPermOpNC"/> does not check that <A>obj</A> maps
      elements of <A>list</A> injectively or that a partial permutation is
      defined by the action of <A>obj</A> on <A>list</A> via <A>func</A>. This
      function should be used only with caution, in situations where it is
      guaranteed that the arguments have the required properties.

    <Func Name="JoinOfIdempotentPartialPermsNC" Arg="arg"/>
    <Returns>A partial permutation or <K>fail</K>.</Returns>
    <Description>
      The join of partial permutations <A>f</A> and <A>g</A> is just the join,
      or supremum,  of <A>f</A> and <A>g</A> under the natural partial
      ordering of partial permutations. <P/>

      <C>JoinOfPartialPerms</C> returns the union of the partial permutations
      in its argument if this defines a partial permutation, and <K>fail</K>
      if it is not.  The argument <A>arg</A> can be a partial permutation
      collection or a number of partial permutations. 
      <P/>

      The function <C>JoinOfIdempotentPartialPermsNC</C> returns the join of
      its argument which is assumed to be a collection of idempotent partial
      permutations or a number of idempotent partial permutations. It is not
      checked that the arguments are idempotents. The performance of this
      function is higher than <C>JoinOfPartialPerms</C> when it is known 
      <E>a priori</E> that the argument consists of idempotents.<P/> 

      The union of <A>f</A> and <A>g</A> is a partial
      permutation if and only if <A>f</A> and <A>g</A> agree on the
      intersection dom(<A>f</A>)<M>\cap</M> dom(<A>g</A>) of their domains and
      the images of dom(<A>f</A>)<M>\setminus</M> dom(<A>g</A>) 
      and dom(<A>g</A>)<M>\setminus</M> dom(<A>f</A>) under

  <Heading>Changing the representation of a partial permutation</Heading>
  It is possible that a partial permutation in &GAP; can be represented by other
  types of objects, or that other types of &GAP; objects can be represented by
  partial permutations. Partial permutations which are
  mathematically permutations can be converted into permutations in &GAP; using
  the function <Ref Oper="AsPermutation"/>.  Similarly, a partial permutation
  can be converted into a transformation using <Ref Oper="AsTransformation"/>.
  <P/>
  
  In this section we describe functions for converting other types of objects
  in &GAP; into partial permutations.

    <Description>
      It can happen that the internal representation of a partial permutation
      uses more memory than necessary. For example, by composing a partial
      permutation with codegree less than 65536 with a partial permutation with
      codegree greater than 65535. It is possible that the resulting partial
      permutation <A>f</A> has its codegree and images stored as
      32-bit integers, while none of its image points exceeds 65536. The
      purpose of this function is to change the internal representation of
      such an <A>f</A> from using 32-bit to using 16-bit integers. <P/>

      Note that the partial permutation <A>f</A> is changed in-place, and
      nothing is returned by this function.

<Heading>Semigroups and inverse semigroups of partial permutations</Heading>

As mentioned at the start of the chapter, every inverse semigroup is isomorphic
to a semigroup of partial permutations, and in this section we describe the
functions in &GAP; specific to partial permutation semigroups. For more information
about semigroups and inverse semigroups see Chapter <Ref Chap="Semigroups"/>. <P/>

The <Package>Semigroups</Package> package contains
many additional functions and methods for computing with semigroups of
partial permutations. In particular, <Package>Semigroups</Package> 
contains more efficient methods than those available in the &GAP; library (and
in many cases more efficient than any other software) for creating semigroups of transformations, calculating their Green's classes, size, elements,
group of units, minimal ideal, small generating sets, testing membership,
finding the inverses of a regular element, factorizing elements over the
generators, and more. <P/>

Since a partial permutation semigroup is also a partial permutation collection, there are special methods for <Ref Attr="DomainOfPartialPermCollection"/>, 
<Ref Attr="ImageOfPartialPermCollection"/>, 
<Ref Attr="FixedPointsOfPartialPerm" Label="for a partial perm coll"/>, 
<Ref Attr="MovedPoints" Label="for a partial perm coll"/>, 
<Ref Attr="NrFixedPoints" Label="for a partial perm coll"/>, 
<Ref Attr="NrMovedPoints" Label="for a partial perm coll"/>,
<Ref Attr="LargestMovedPoint" Label="for a partial perm coll"/>, and 
<Ref Attr="SmallestMovedPoint" Label="for a partial perm coll"/> 
when applied to a partial permutation semigroup.

  <Description> 
    A <E>partial perm semigroup</E> is simply a semigroup consisting of partial
    permutations, which may or may not be an inverse semigroup. An object
    <A>obj</A> in &GAP; is a partial perm semigroup if and only if it satisfies
    <Ref Prop="IsSemigroup"/> and <Ref Filt="IsPartialPermCollection"/>.<P/>

    A <E>partial perm monoid</E> is a monoid consisting of partial
    permutations. An object in &GAP; is a partial perm monoid if it satisfies 
    <Ref Prop="IsMonoid"/> and <Ref Filt="IsPartialPermCollection"/>.<P/> 

Note that it is possible for a partial perm semigroup to have a
multiplicative neutral element (i.e. an identity element) but not to satisfy
<C>IsPartialPermMonoid</C>. For example,
<Example><![CDATA[
gap> f := PartialPerm( [ 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 10 ], [ 2, 6, 7, 9, 1, 5 ] );;
gap> S := Semigroup(f, One(f));
<commutative partial perm monoid of rank 9 with 1 generator>
gap> IsMonoid(S);
true
gap> IsPartialPermMonoid(S);
true]]></Example>

Note that unlike transformation semigroups, the <Ref Attr="One"/> of a partial permutation semigroup must coincide with the multiplicative neutral element, if either exists.<P/>
