##             inds is a sublist of [1..n].
##  
##  We assume that pivots is monotonically increasing.
##  TrigonalizeSubset computes destructively a trigonal form of the submatrix
##  mat{inds} using row operations. (So with inds = [1..Length(mat)] the whole

##  This function could easily be provided from the kernel for compressed 
##  matrices, but it is not so bad as it is.
##  
##  I have experimented with PositionNonZero, PositionNot, POSITION_NOT,
##  but the fastest way to find the new pivots seems to be to use none of
##  these. This is probably reasonable for dense matrices, but may not be
##  true for very sparse matrices.

##  This is an experimental function. Instead of trigonalizing in one step,
##  we trigonalize num intervals of rows, then sort all rows such that the 
##  list of pivots in non-decreasing, and start over. This is done rounds
##  times and afterwards the rest is done in a single interval.
##  The nice point is here that the total running time is almost the same for 
##  a large range of values for num and rounds. This means we have split the
##  whole work into many small tasks with neglectible overhead.
##  
##  I have played with various possibilities to vary the lengths of the
##  intervals of rows given to TrigonalizeSubset during the algorithm.
##  The best seems to be to keep these intervals the same all the time
##  and do the cleaning interval-wise for about 2 * #intervals rounds.
##  Then very little is left to do for the final cleanup.

##  So, now lets do the same with several threads.   
##  
##  We first give a straight forward variant TrigonalizeByThreads1.
##

##  mechanism has very little to do with the specific application. 
##  
##  Therefore we provide some completely generic utility functions to start and 
##  destroy a number of threads and channels. And also a generic function which 
##  distributes tasks among such a collection of threads.
##  
##  Using this we can write an elegant and short function
##  TrigonalizeByThreads.
