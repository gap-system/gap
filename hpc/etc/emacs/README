This directory formerly contained files for GAP editing mode for emacs:

* comint.el and gap-mode.el (versions from 2001, based on the
  original 1993 files by Michael J. Smith, also available from
  http://www.gap-system.org/Packages/Contrib/contrib.html )

* gap-process.el: version provided in 2005 by Gary Zablackis

They are no longer redistributed with GAP, but still available at 
ftp://ftp.gap-system.org/pub/gap/gap44/deposit/external/emacs/

There are also newer versions of GAP emacs modes available elsewhere:

* Patch to add syntax highlighting to the emacs gap-mode 
  by Volker Braun: http://www.stp.dias.ie/~vbraun/gap/

* An Emacs major-mode for editing GAP files 
  by Ivan Andrus: https://bitbucket.org/gvol/gap-mode

which you may wish to try. We did not test any of the mentioned
emacs modes as a part of the release process, but received reports
that they were working for some users.
