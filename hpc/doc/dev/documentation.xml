<Chapter Label="Chap-Documentation">
<Heading>Maintaining the &GAP; documentation</Heading>

This chapter explains shortly how the &GAP; documentation is organized
and how to produce the viewable documents from the sources. 

<Section Label="Sect-DocDirs">
<Heading>The source of the &GAP; documentation</Heading>

Mention that manual examples should fit in 72 character width, and
that examples should run as shown if all examples within a chapter
are run in a fresh  &GAP; in default configuration with 
<C>ScreenSize([72]);</C>.

</Section>

<Section Label="Sect-DocCompile">
<Heading>How to compile the &GAP; manuals from the sources</Heading>

To compile the &GAP; manuals from sources, call

<Verb><![CDATA[
make manuals
]]></Verb>

in the &GAP; root directory. This will compile each of the three main &GAP;
manuals twice to ensure that cross-references are resolved. 
<P/>

After that, each of the directories <F>ref</F>, <F>tut</F> and <F>changes</F>
will contain a build log in the file <F>make_manuals.out</F>.
<P/>

If you need to compile a single manual book, call
<Verb><![CDATA[
gap makedocrel.g
]]></Verb>
in the corresponding directory (<F>ref</F>, <F>tut</F> or <F>changes</F>).
This is convenient when you're working on the documentation and want to 
check if the changed manual book compiles, so you need not to recompile 
all manual books from scratch.
