To build the manuals type:

  ./make_doc

in this directory. (Don't run: make  ... the Makefile is not up-to-date.)

If you have problems look in the HOWTOS directory (specifically:
../HOWTOS/manual.HOWTO) for details of the software needed on your
system to build the manuals. If you have tee on your system you might 
like to run make_doc again piping the output through tee e.g. if your shell
is tcsh then:

  ./make_doc |& tee doc.log

will direct standard output and standard error both to the file doc.log and
display it on the screen. This gives you the chance to look at diagnostics 
later at leisure, that have rushed past your eyes.

Below, we'll attempt to diagnose some problems that might arise:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
* I get make error messages:
make: ../../etc/buildman.pe: Command not found
make: *** [._number] Error 127

SOLUTION: Check first that you do have etc/buildman.pe and it's executable.
(etc is ../etc relative to the doc directory). Almost certainly your
problem is that perl is somewhere other than in /usr/bin. Do: 

  which perl

and edit the first line of etc/buildman.pe to reflect the correct path.
While you're at it fix etc/convert.pl too (same fix). Also, do:

  perl -v

to check what version of perl you have (you need perl5, and it probably
needs to be perl 5.004_004 or later).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
* I get TeX error messages:
! TeX capacity exceeded, sorry [pool size=94767].

SOLUTION: See HOWTOS/manual.HOWTO for this one. Essentially you need to
increase the pool_size (250000 is known to be enough).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
* I get awk error messages:
Hyphenating long index entries
awk: syntax error near line 1
awk: illegal statement near line 1
awk: syntax error near line 5
awk: illegal statement near line 5

DIAGNOSIS: This problem used to occur when doc/manualindex was run, with
the awk on SUNs with SunOS 5.5 (which doesn't understand the `match'
command). 
SOLUTION: Update doc/manualindex (the latest version uses `index' instead
of `match'). While you are at it, update doc/htm/onehtmlindex (this had the
same problem.)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
* I get TeX error messages:
Chapter `Index' .
(manual.ind
! Undefined control sequence.
l.1 \begin
          {theindex}
?

DIAGNOSIS: This happens if the manual.mst file is missing in any of doc/ext
doc/new doc/prg doc/ref doc/tut. When doc/manualindex is executed it calls
makeindex. Without manual.mst present makeindex produces a LaTeX style
index with \begin{index} .. \end{index} which TeX doesn't understand.
SOLUTION: Ensure the manual.mst file is present.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
* I get TeX error messages:
! Undefined control sequence.
<argument> \kernttindent 
                         \\input ../gapmacro.tex
\typewriter ...e {\writetyper \chardef `=96 \tt #1
                                                  }
\cloparen ...ule \relax }\noindent \typewriter #1'
                                                  }
l.32 \){\kernttindent\\input ../gapmacro.tex}

?

DIAGNOSIS: This happens with older versions of doc/gapmacro.tex that haven't
defined \kernttindent (when tex-ing the ext manual).
SOLUTION: Update doc/gapmacro.tex.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
* I get empty (except for the cover page) fullindex.dvi, fullindex.ps,
  fullindex.pdf

DIAGNOSIS: This used to occur when awk on a system was actually mawk
(which doesn't recognise the string "\{" as being the same as "{").
SOLUTION: Update doc/allmanualsindex.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
* I get perl warning messages:
Value of <HANDLE> construct can be "0"; test with defined() at ../../etc/convert.pl line 338.
Value of <HANDLE> construct can be "0"; test with defined() at ../../etc/convert.pl line 65535.
Value of <HANDLE> construct can be "0"; test with defined() at ../../etc/convert.pl line 1033.
Name "main::betb" used only once: possible typo at ../../etc/convert.pl line 1106.

DIAGNOSIS: These are from bugs in an old version of etc/convert.pl.
SOLUTION: Update etc/convert.pl.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
* I get a perl warning message like:
!! tth: not in path.
which: no tth in (/opt/kde/bin:/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/openwin/bin:/usr/games:.:/usr/share/texmf/bin)
... Maths formulae will vanish! Install tth or avoid -t option.

DIAGNOSIS: The message says it all; etc/convert.pl, when called with the -t
option, uses tth (TeX to HTML) to convert maths formulae (anything appearing
in $...$ or $$...$$).
SOLUTION: Either install tth (see HOWTOS/manual.HOWTO) or do the generation
of the HTML docs manually without the -t option (change to directory doc/htm
and do:

  ../../etc/convert.pl -c ../XXX XXX

for XXX replaced by ext, new, prg, ref and tut in succession).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Most other warning/error messages can be ignored e.g.
Creating B all manuals index.
fgrep: ext/indxB.htm: No such file or directory

This fgrep error message is normal ... since the ext manual has no B
index entries, there is no ext/indxB.htm. The script doc/htm/onehtmlindex
doesn't do anything particularly clever in looking for the manual index files 
for each letter, and behaves correctly when fgrep fails to find a file.
