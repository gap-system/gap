<Chapter Label="Rings">
<Heading>Rings</Heading>

This chapter deals with domains that are additive groups
(see <Ref Func="IsAdditiveGroup"/> closed under multiplication <C>*</C>.
Such a domain, if <C>*</C> and <C>+</C> are distributive,
is called a <E>ring</E> in &GAP;.
Each division ring, field (see&nbsp;<Ref Chap="Fields and Division Rings"/>),
or algebra (see&nbsp;<Ref Chap="Algebras"/>) is a ring.
Important examples of rings are the integers (see&nbsp;<Ref Chap="Integers"/>)
and matrix rings.
<!-- %(see&nbsp;<Ref Chap="???"/>). -->
<!-- % residue class rings ? -->
<P/>
In the case of a <E>ring-with-one</E>, additional multiplicative structure is
present, see&nbsp;<Ref Func="IsRingWithOne"/>. There is a little support in &GAP;
for rings that have no additional structure: it is possible to perform some
computations for small finite rings; infinite rings are handled by &GAP; in 
an acceptable way in the case that they are algebras. 
<P/>
Also, the <Package>SONATA</Package> package provides support for near-rings,
and a related functionality for multiplicative semigroups of near-rings is
available in the <Package>Smallsemi</Package> package.
<P/>
Several functions for ring elements,
such as <Ref Func="IsPrime"/> and <Ref Func="Factors"/>,
are defined only relative to a ring <A>R</A>,
which can be entered as an optional argument;
if <A>R</A> is omitted then a <E>default ring</E> is formed
from the ring elements given as arguments,
see&nbsp;<Ref Func="DefaultRing" Label="for ring elements"/>.

A <E>ring homomorphism</E> is a mapping between two rings
that respects addition and multiplication.

<P/>

Currently &GAP; supports ring homomorphisms between finite rings
(using straightforward methods)
and ring homomorphisms with additional structures,
where source and range are in fact algebras
and where also the linear structure is respected,
see <Ref Sect="Homomorphisms of Algebras"/>.
