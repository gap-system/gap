<Chapter Label="Finitely Presented Algebras">
<Heading>Finitely Presented Algebras</Heading>

Currently the &GAP; library contains only few functions dealing with
general finitely presented algebras,
so this chapter is merely a placeholder.
<P/>
The special case of finitely presented <E>Lie</E> algebras is described
in&nbsp;<Ref Sect="Finitely Presented Lie Algebras"/>,
and there is also a &GAP; package <C>fplsa</C> for computing structure constants
of <E>f</E>initely <E>p</E>resented <E>L</E>ie (<E>s</E>uper)<E>a</E>lgebras.
<P/>
<!-- % Finitely presented <E>associative</E> algebras will eventually be handled by -->
<!-- % vector enumeration techniques. -->

</Chapter>
