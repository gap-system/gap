<Section Label="The Library of Tables of Marks">
<Heading>The Library of Tables of Marks</Heading>

The &GAP; package <Package>TomLib</Package> provides access to several
hundred tables of marks of almost simple groups and their maximal subgroups.
If this package is installed then the tables from this database can be
accessed via <Ref Func="TableOfMarks" Label="for a string"/> with argument
a string.
If also the &GAP; Character Table Library is installed and contains the
ordinary character table of the group for which one wants to fetch the table
of marks then one can also call
<Ref Func="TableOfMarks" Label="for a string"/>
<!-- This reference is not correct.
     The Character Table Library or the ``Interface'' section above
     should document this method,
     and then an external reference should be created. -->
with argument the character table.
<P/>
A list of all names of tables of marks that are provided by the
<Package>TomLib</Package> package can be obtained via
<Ref Func="AllLibTomNames" BookName="tomlib"/>.
<P/>
<Example><![CDATA[
gap> names:= AllLibTomNames();;
gap> "A5" in names;
true
]]></Example>
