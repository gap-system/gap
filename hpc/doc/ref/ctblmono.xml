<Chapter Label="Monomiality Questions">
<Heading>Monomiality Questions</Heading>

This chapter describes functions dealing with the monomiality
of finite (solvable) groups and their characters.
<P/>
<#Include Label="[1]{ctblmono}">
<P/>
Several <E>examples</E> in this chapter use the symmetric group <M>S_4</M>
and the special linear group <M>SL(2,3)</M>.
For running the examples, you must first define the groups,
for example as follows.
<P/>
<Example><![CDATA[
gap> S4:= SymmetricGroup( 4 );;  SetName( S4, "S4" );
gap> Sl23:= SL( 2, 3 );;
]]></Example>
