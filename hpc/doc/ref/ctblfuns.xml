This chapter describes operations for <E>class functions of finite groups</E>.
For operations concerning <E>character tables</E>,
see Chapter&nbsp;<Ref Chap="Character Tables"/>.
<P/>
Several examples in this chapter require the &GAP; Character Table Library
to be available.
If it is not yet loaded then we load it now.
