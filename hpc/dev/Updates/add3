Fix: efficiency issue

!! Description
The most common cases of Add on three arguments
bypass method selection, avoiding the cost of determining
homogeneity for plain lists of mutable objects.

! Test Code
# the test is that this is quick (sub 1 second on my laptop) rather than minutes
gap> d:=NewDictionary([[1],[2..10]],true);\
<lookup dictionary>
gap>  for i in PartitionsSet([1..10]) do AddDictionary(d,i,1); od ;
gap>  Sum(PartitionsSet([1..10]),x->LookupDictionary(d,x));
