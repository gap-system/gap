% [Required] When the change was checked in, format 'yyyy/mm/dd':
!! Date

% [Required] Initials should suffice here:
!! Changed by

% [Optional] Only if applicable:
! Reported by

% [Required] Choose one or more entries and/or add new ones;
% but always use either the 'Fix:' or the 'New:' prefix
!! Type of Change
Fix: wrong result
Fix: inappropriate error message
Fix: infinite loop
Fix: efficiency issue
Fix: crash
New: extended functionality
New: new functionality
New: improved documentation

% [Required] For the description use plain text
!! Description

% [Optional, but highly desirable] If possible, provide some code
% in test file format which allows to check if a change was applied
% to an installation. Provide input and output, including prompts,
% exactly as in a GAP session.
! Test Code

% [Optional] If possible, provide some information about a temporary fix,
% workaround etc., maybe with a link to some longer description or a file
% with some code. Use plain text here.
! Prefetch

% [Required] Describe here how to find out where the changes were made.
%
% - for immediate changes in the stable branch, it is sufficient to just 
%   specify changed file(s) instead of the hexadecimal changeset id. Note
%   thet adding the entry describing the change should be a part of the 
%   same commit as the change itself, so that adding/merging/backing out 
%   these changes will keep dev/Update in sync. If you will revisit this 
%   change before the next GAP release, you may consider updating its entry
%   in dev/Update file, specifying the full hexadecimal changeset id
%   (160-bit identifier) of the previous change(s).
%
% - for changes made in feature branches, the change to dev/Update should
%   be made in the same feature branch, so it will be merged into default
%   or stable branch together with actual changes and reverting the merge
%   will also revert the dev/Update file. It is sufficient to specify here 
%   just the name of the feature branch. Instead of that, you may also put 
%   there the full hexadecimal changeset id (160-bit identifier) of the 
%   latest revision of the code in this branch before the merge (this is
%   especially relevant to feature branches that were merged into release
%   branches multiple times during their lifetime, so without changeset id
%   it would be quite difficult to find corresponding changesets).
%
% Since by default, Mercurial displays only the first 12 characters of
% the full hexadecimal changeset id, to see the full version, use --debug
% option, e.g. 'hg --debug log'. Do not use the short revision number
% since it makes sense only within your clone.
!! Changeset

% [Required] Finish your entry with this:
