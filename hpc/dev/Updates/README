%%  This file explains how to document the changes that will be published with
%%  the next GAP release.
%%
%%  Documented changes entries will be used for producing:
%%  - the update announcement
%%  - additions to `tst/bugfix.tst'
%%  - an HTML page that lists known bugs and intended new features
%%  - an entry in the `Changes' manual describing the new release.
%%  Also, tests codes supplied with changes descriptions will be used 
%%  in nightly tests.
%%  
%%  This directory contains two templates for documenting changes:
%%  - 'template-long' with explanatory comments
%%  - 'template-short' without comments
%% 
%%  To document the change, copy one of these templates to a new file with
%%  some name describing the change (e.g. 'inputlogto-bug', 'polyrings-view',
%%  'Log2Int-32bit-bug' etc.) and fill in the details in the template. You
%%  need to fill in least the following fields: "Date", "Changed by", "Type 
%%  of Change", "Description" and "Changeset". Also, fill in "Reported by", 
%%  if applicable, and, if relevant, provide some code in test file format 
%%  in "Test Code" field (that is, provide input and output, including GAP
%%  prompts, exactly as in a GAP session). You may delete unused optional 
%%  fields or leave them empty. 
%%
%%  Formal rules for filling the templates, to allow their easy parsing by 
%%  a script:
%%  - lines starting with `%' are comments and are ignored
%%  - empty lines are ignored
%%  - lines starting with `!' must not be changed. They describe the type
%%    of information in the following lines until the next `!'-line (thus,
%%    information must be entered *after* and not *in* `!'-lines)
%%  - lines starting with `!!' denote required fields, other fields are
%%    optional
%%  - the text behind the `!' is case and whitespace insensitive
%%  - each entry must be finished with an `! End' line
%%
%%  When the file with the description of a change is ready, add it to the 
%%  version control with 'hg add <filename>' and commit it.
%%
%%  To make sure that the change is documented in the appropriate branch:
%%
%%  - for adding a change in the stable branch (e.g. to make GAP 4.5.7 after 
%%    GAP 4.5.6), call 'hg update stable-4.5' and document it in the stable
%%    branch.
%%
%%  - for adding a change in the default branch,(e.g. to make GAP 4.6 after 
%%    GAP 4.5.17) call 'hg update default' and document it in the default
%%    branch.
%%
%%  Please remember that you must NOT document in the stable branch any 
%%  changes which exist only in the default (and integration) branches !!!
