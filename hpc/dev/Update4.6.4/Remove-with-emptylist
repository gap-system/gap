!! Type of Change
Fix: internal data corruption
!! Description
The kernel method for Remove did not raise an error in
case of empty lists, but corrupted the object.
The error message in a library method is also
improved.
! Test Code
##  gap> list := [];;
##  gap> Remove(list);
##  Error, Remove: <list> must not be empty
##  not in any function at line 2 of *stdin*
##  you may replace <list> via 'return <list>;'
