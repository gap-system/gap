!! Type of Change
Fix: inappropriate error message
!! Description
The method for <Ref Attr="SlotUsagePattern"/> for straight line
programs had a bug which triggered an error, if the straight line
program contained unnecessary steps. This is fixed now.
! Test Code
gap> slp := StraightLineProgram(
> [ [ 1, -1 ], [ 2, -1 ], [ 3, -1 ], [ 4, -1 ], [ 5, -1 ], [ 4, 1, 10, 1 ], 
> [ 11, -1 ], [ 1, 0 ], [ 1, 0 ], [ 1, 0 ], [ 1, 0 ], [ 1, 0 ], [ 1, 0 ], 
> [ 1, 0 ], [ 1, 0 ], [ 1, 0 ], [ 8, 0, 10, 1, 8, 0, 5, 1 ], 
> [ 22, 1, 1, 1, 7, 1, 6, 1, 22, -1 ], [ 1, 0 ], [ 1, 0 ], [ 1, 0 ], 
> [ 23, 1 ], [ 27, 4 ], [ 28, 1, 13, 1 ], [ 27, 1 ] ],5);;
