! Reported by
CJ
!! Type of Change
Fix: efficiency issue
!! Description
`Union' had O(n^3) behaviour when given many ranges (e.g. 10 seconds to 
find a union of 1000 1-element sets). The new implementation reduces that 
to O(n log n) (and 4ms for the 10 second example), at the cost of not 
merging ranges as well as before in some rare cases.
! Test Code
# This should now return the result instantly:
gap> L := List(Shuffle([1..1000]), x -> Set([x]));;
