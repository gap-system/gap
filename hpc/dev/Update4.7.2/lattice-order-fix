! Reported by
Attila Egri-Nagy
!! Type of Change
Fix: wrong result
!! Description
IsLatticeOrderBinaryRelation only checked the existence of upper bounds but
not the uniqueness of the least upper bound (and dually for lower bounds), 
so in some cases it could return the wrong answer.
! Test Code
gap> rel := BinaryRelationOnPoints([[2,3],[4,5],[4,5],[6],[6],[]]);
Binary Relation on 6 points
gap> rel := ReflexiveClosureBinaryRelation(TransitiveClosureBinaryRelation(rel));
Binary Relation on 6 points
gap> IsLatticeOrderBinaryRelation(rel);
false
gap> 
gap> rel := BinaryRelationOnPoints([[2,3],[4,5],[4],[6],[6],[]]);
Binary Relation on 6 points
gap> rel := ReflexiveClosureBinaryRelation(TransitiveClosureBinaryRelation(rel));
Binary Relation on 6 points
gap> IsLatticeOrderBinaryRelation(rel);
true
