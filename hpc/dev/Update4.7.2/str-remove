!! Type of Change
Fix: wrong result

!! Description
Removing the last character in a string was supposed to overwrite the old
removed character in memory with a zero byte, but failed to do so due to an
off-by-one error. For most GAP operations, this has no visible effect, except
for those which directly operate on the underlying memory representation of
strings. For example, when trying to use such a string to reference a record
entry, a (strange) error could be triggered.

! Test Code
gap> record := rec( foo := "bar" );
rec( foo := "bar" )
gap> fooo := "fooo";
"fooo"
gap> Unbind( fooo[4] );
gap> record.(fooo);
"bar"

!! Changeset
src/string.c

!! End
