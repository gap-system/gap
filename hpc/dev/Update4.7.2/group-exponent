!! Type of Change
Fix: efficiency issue

!! Description
Computing the exponent of a finite group G could be extremely slow.
This was due to a slow default method being used, which computed
all conjugacy classes of elements in order to compute the exponent.
We now instead compute Sylow subgroups P_1, ..., P_k of G and
use the easily verified equality exp(G) = exp(P_1) x ... x exp(P_k).
This is usually at least as fast and in many cases orders of
magnitude faster.

The test code provided below runs in a few milliseconds
(for the group H
resp. 

! Test Code
gap> G:=SmallGroup(2^7*9,33);;
gap> H:=DirectProduct(G, ElementaryAbelianGroup(2^10));;
gap> Exponent(H); # should take at most a few milliseconds
72
gap> K := PerfectGroup(2688,3);;
gap> Exponent(K); # should take at most a few seconds
168
