!! Type of Change
Fix: wrong result
!! Description
Fixed inconsistent behaviour of QuotientMod( Integers , <r>, <s>, <m> )
in the case where s and m are not coprime (this fix also corrects the
division behaviour of ZmodnZ objects).
! Test Code
gap> QuotientMod(4, 2, 6);
fail
gap> QuotientMod(2, 4, 6);
fail
gap> a := ZmodnZObj(2, 6);; b := ZmodnZObj(4, 6);;
gap> a/b;
fail
gap> b/a;
fail
