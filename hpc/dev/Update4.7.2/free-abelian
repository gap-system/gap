!! Type of Change
New: new functionality

!! Description
A new group constructor FreeAbelianGroup() for free abelian groups has
been added. By default, it creates suitable fp groups. However, this is
not very useful right now, as these groups do not offer much
functionality. But in the future, other implementations will be
provided, e.g. by the polycyclic package.

! Test Code
gap> F:=FreeAbelianGroup(3);
<fp group on the generators [ f1, f2, f3 ]>
gap> IsAbelian(F);
true
gap> Size(F);
infinity

!! Changeset
mh/freeabelian

!! End
