!! Type of Change
New: new functionality
!! Description
An info class called `InfoObsolete' with the default level 0 is introduced.
Setting it to 1 will trigger warnings at runtime if an obsolete variable
declared with `DeclareObsoleteSynonym' is used. This is recommended for 
testing GAP distribution and packages.
! Test Code
gap> foo:=function() return 42; end;
function(  ) ... end
gap> DeclareObsoleteSynonym("bar","foo","4.8");
gap> SetInfoLevel(InfoObsolete,1);
gap> bar();
#I  'bar' is obsolete.
#I  It may be removed in the future release of GAP 4.8
#I  Use foo instead.
