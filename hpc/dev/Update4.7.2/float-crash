!! Type of Change
Fix: crash

!! Description
The parser for floating point numbers contained a bug that could cause GAP to
crash or to get into a state where the only action left to the user was to
exit GAP via Ctrl-D. For example, entering four dots with spaces between them
on the GAP prompt and then pressing the return key caused GAP to exit.

The reason was (ironically) an error check in the innards of the float
parser code which invoked the GAP Error() function at a point where
it should not have.

! Test Code
gap> . . . .
Syntax error: Badly formed number, need a digit before or after the decimal po\
int in stream line 1
. . . .

!! Changeset
lib/float.gi

!! End
