!! Type of Change
Fix: efficiency issue
New: extended functionality
New: improved documentation
!! Description
The GAP help system now recognises some common different spelling patterns
(for example, -ise/-ize, -isation/-ization, solvable/soluble) and searches
for all possible spelling options even when the synonyms are not declared.
! Test Code
# Also try to search e.g. for `??Center' and `??Centre', 
# `??Factorisation' and `??Factorization' and check that
# the search results are identical.
