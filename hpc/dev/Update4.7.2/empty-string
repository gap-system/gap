!! Type of Change
Fix: inconsistent behavior

!! Description
Empty strings were treated slightly differently than other strings in
the GAP C kernel, for historical reasons. This resulted in various
inconsistencies. For example, IsStringRep("") returned true, but a
method installed for arguments of type IsStringRep would NOT be invoked
when called with an empty string.

We remove this special case in the GAP kernel (which dates back the very
early days of GAP 4 in 1996). This uncovers one issue in the kernel
function POSITION_SUBSTRING (when calling it with an empty string as
second argument), which we also fix.

! Test Code
gap> IsStringRep("");
true
gap> RepresentationsOfObject("");
[ "IsStringRep", "IsInternalRep" ]
gap> DeclareOperation("TestOp",[IsStringRep]);
gap> InstallMethod(TestOp,[IsStringRep], function(x) Print("Your string: '",x,"'\n"); end);
gap> TestOp("");
Your string: ''
gap> PositionSublist("xyz", "");
