! Type of Change
Fix: infinite loop

! Description

For a semigroup of associative words that is not the full semigroup of
all associative words, the methods for Size and IsTrivial call one
another.

This change introduces an immediate method for Size based on the 
generators (it's always 0, 1 or infinity).

The original reported bug now runs into a slightly more reasonable No
Method Found error.

! Test Code
gap> s := FreeSemigroup("a","b");
<free semigroup on the generators [ a, b ]>
gap> t := Subsemigroup(s,[s.1]);
<semigroup with 1 generator>
gap> t := Subsemigroup(s,[s.1]);
<semigroup with 1 generator>
gap> HasSize(t);
true
gap> Size(t);
infinity
gap> t := Subsemigroup(s,[]);
<semigroup with 0 generators>
gap> HasSize(t);
true
gap> Size(t);
0
