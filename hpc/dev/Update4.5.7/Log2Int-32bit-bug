! Type of Change
Fix: wrong result, crash
! Description
On 32 bit systems we can have long integers n such that Log2Int(n) is
not an immediate integer. In such cases Log2Int gave wrong or corrupted
results which in turn could crash GAP, e.g., in ViewObj(n).

This problem occured in both, GAP with or without GMP support.
! Test Code
gap> a:=(2^(2^15))^(2^14);;
gap> Log2Int(a);
