Fix: crash

! Description

Some patterns of use of UpEnv and DownEnv lead to a segfault

The bug dated back many years to an ommission when refactoring the break loop 
handling. The variable ErrorLVars0 was not being set before entering a break
loop (or indeed, at all).

No test code, because it needs to be tested in a break loop.
