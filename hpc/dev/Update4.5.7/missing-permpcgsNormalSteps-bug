! Type of Change
Fix: Work around problem caused by package method
! Description
Method in CRISP create pcgs for permutation groups for which the entry
permpcgsNormalSteps is missing.
! Test Code
gap> p:=7;;
gap> F:=FreeGroup("a","b","c","d","e","f");;
gap> AssignGeneratorVariables(F);;
#I  Assigned the global variables [ a, b, c, d, e, f ]
gap> G:=F/[a^p,b^p,c^p,d^p,e^p,f^p,Comm(b,a)*c^-1,Comm(c,a)*d^-1,
> Comm(d,a)*e^-1,Comm(d,b)*f^-1,Comm(e,b)*f^-1, Comm(d,c)*f,
> Comm(a,e),Comm(a,f),Comm(b,c),Comm(b,f),Comm(c,e),Comm(c,f),
