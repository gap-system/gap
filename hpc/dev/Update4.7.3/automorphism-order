!! Type of Change
Fix: wrong result
!! Description
The Order method for group homomorphisms newly introduced in GAP 4.7
had a bug that caused it to sometimes return incorrect results.
This has been fixed now.
! Test Code
gap> G:=AbelianGroup([17,19]);
<pc group of size 323 with 2 generators>
gap> f1:=Pcgs(G)[1];;f2:=Pcgs(G)[2];;
gap> phi:=GroupHomomorphismByImages(G,G,[f2,f1],[f2^2,f1^2]);
[ f2, f1 ] -> [ f2^2, f1^2 ]
gap> Order(phi);
72
gap> IsOne(phi^Order(phi));
true
