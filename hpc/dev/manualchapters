% Comments:
+1AK Move the relevant parts to the Reference Manual,
  put only a very short paragraph into the Tutorial.
  Left only the introduction and then two sections ("The GAP system" and
  "Further Information about GAP") reused from the preface to
  the reference manual. Chapters in the "manualchapters" file renumbered.
+3cAK Copyright notice: adjust the year?
  Made it automatically adjusted using the &RELEASEYEAR; entity
+3cAK Is it really a good idea to include release specific information such as
  a detailed list of changes in the beginning of the Tutorial?
  (This information is available on the GAP web pages,
  and I could imagine a collection of changes w.r.t. older versions being
  part of the Reference Manual --really as a reference-- for example as an
  appendix chapter.)
  I have not tried to beautify the changes list, since the next release
  will anyhow have a new list.
  TODO: indeed it should be an appendix, 
  references to this list should be updated
+2AK In the same paragraphs, the importance of packages should be emphasized
  more than it is now.
  (Perhaps simply add ``see below''?) and recommmend their usage 
-6 Should the references to the Reference Manuals and to the web site
  (for example section ``Release history and Prefaces'') be turned
  into hyperlinks in the HTML version?
+2AK put a note about the temporary preface for beta release which will be
   revised later
+1SL revise prefaces: check for consistency - all outdated information 
   must be updated. This mostly relates to ``Authors and Maintainers''
   and ``Acknowledgements'' sections.

+1AK ``This is one of four parts of the GAP documentation ..''
  This is no longer correct.
+1AK Add a link to the Tutorial in the HTML version.
+1AK ``This manual is divided into chapters. Each chapter is divided into
  sections and, within each section, important definitions are numbered.
  References are therefore triples.''
  Better state that the manual is divided into chapters, sections, and
  subsections; this is mentioned also in the chapter about the help system.
+1AK ``in each of the four manuals''
+1FL+MN  Resolved by deleting this section! I don't think that any 
  explanation of this kind is necessary, all of this is self-explanatory
  when one reads the manual. (FL)
  Manual Conventions:
  The statements about boldface, italics, monospace font are not correct.
  (And in the old version, the examples were not shown as intended.
  Also the description of `Oper', with certain single letters at the end of
  the line, is no longer correct.  (And again, the old example was wrong.)
  adjust to the current situation!
+5FL+MN Became irrelevant because of solution of previous point. (FL)

  Several instances of ``in the printed manual'' must be changed.
  Note that the old manual was essentially a TeX document --this defines the
  term ``printed manual''-- which was used to produce also the online help
  and an HTML version; so the PDF (or DVI) version was regarded as the most
  important format of the manual.

  I don't think that this belongs here. In the beginning there is the
  sensible hint to start reading about the help system. (FL)
  The new manual should express that there is one source text which is
  processed to obtain three variants, and that each format has its strengths
  and its limitations.
  One such aspect is the way how formulas are shown.
  The formulation in the old manual is not very useful:
  I would regard the appearance of symbols as equally important as the
  appearance of subscripts and superscripts.
+1AK Shouldn't the general information parts from the Preface of the Tutorial
  better be moved to the Reference Manual? (yes)
  TODO: all preface should go to the beginning of the reference manual 
  (except list of changes which should go to the appendix). Sections 1.1 
  and 1.5 of it should be also reused in the tutorial (using INCLUDE
  directives in GAPDoc).
+3c ``Pages are numbered consecutively'' --omit this in the HTML version?

% Comments:
+2FL Invoking the Help:
  ``dvi files (produced by &TeX;)'' --replaced by LaTeX
  Removed, we no longer (need to) support dvi, use pdf (which often has
  hyperlinks).
+2FL Browsing through the Sections:
  - ``?< displays the section preceding the previously shown section,
    and ?> takes you to the section following the previously shown one.''
    --This is not true for GAPDoc format manuals, here the help is subsection
    oriented, i. e., if one asks for a particular topic then the corresponding
    subsection is opened (not the beginning of the section that contains this
    subsection), and if one goes further with ?> then the help is opened at the
    following subsection.
       changed to "section or subsection"
    (This holds also if one has used the pager facilities for moving forwards
    to the end of the whole chapter, say.)
       GAP cannot know what a user did in his/her (external) pager
  - ``?<< takes you back to the first section of the current chapter,
    which gives an overview of the sections described in this chapter.''
    --Is this really true for all chapters?  (Would it be useful to state this
    as a rule for writing documentation?)
       removed the "overview" statement
+2FL The description of the commands ``?[book:]sections'' and
  ``?[book:][chapters]'' is not sufficient.
  If no book is prescribed then the table of contents of the first book is
  shown, quitting the help leads to the table of contents of the second book
  and so on.
  What is the difference between ``?sections'' and ``?chapters''?
  What is the difference between ``?IO:'', ``?IO:sections'', ``?IO:chapters''?
  For GAPDoc books there seems to be no difference,
     mentioned that for some books ?sections and ?chapters may show the 
     same full table of contents
     that ?IO: and ?IO:chapters are the same was already in the description
  for other book such as the book for the `Hopf' package,
  there are a ``Table of Chapters'' and a ``Table of Sections''.
     yes both were generated with the old style manuals
  (BTW, shouldn't it be ``Contents'' rather than ``Content'', in the text of
  this section as well as in the displayed help pages?)
     it seems that "Content" only occurs in manuals generated by old
     versions of GAPDoc, so this is already fixed
+2FL Changing the Help Viewer:
  +FL ``dvi: The standard output format of &TeX;. Only useful if &TeX; is
    installed on your system.'' --Is &TeX really needed for using xdvi?
        removed the 'dvi' and 'ps' parts from the description, we now only
        provide pdf
  - ``HTML: ... Some books  use special  symbol fonts for  formulae and
    need an appropriate web browser for correct display.'' --Which book
    formats use symbol fonts? And in this case, is the choice of the browser
    the problem or the browser configuration (see below)?
        made a bit clearer and put the remark in parentheses (in my eyes
        one has to "misconfigure" the browser to display these symbol fonts,
        so will not provide more details
+2FL SetHelpViewer:
  - ``Furthermore the  terminal (window) should use a fixed  width font and
    we suggest to take one with <C>ISO-8859-1</C> (also called <C>latin1</C>)
    encoding.'' --Is this still true?
        now suggest terminal with UTF-8 encoding (which is the default on
        all modern systems anyway)
  - ``Note, that for  some books the browser must be configured to use symbol
    fonts.'' --Does this hold only for non-GAPDoc books? (Be specific!)
        put in parentheses with the formulation "some old manuals"
  - Related with the item above: 
    ``Formulae which use symbol fonts may be unreadable.'' --Tell in which
    formats symbol fonts may appear.
        also put in parentheses
  +AK Why must TeX (LaTeX?) be installed in order to use xdvi?
        FL: you need the fonts, they are not contained in a dvi-file
        (contrary to pdf-files)
     removed mentioning the help viewers 'xdvi' 
     removed remark on font configuration for 'xpdf'
+5*AK Pager:

  above an example!)

% Comments:
-6* unified kilobytes vs. KBytes vs. Kilobytes (same for mega and giga),
  should be consistent throughout the manual (semi-automatic)
  What's the preferred form??? kB, Kb, Kbytes? Not KB=Knuth-Bendix, of course.
+6*AK unified `ctr-C', `ctrl-C' etc. (with various <C> and <A> markup)
  to <B>Ctrl-C</B>, should be consistent throughout the manual
+2*AK Are the following statements about the command line options `-m' and `-o'
  correct:
  ``Under UNIX the default amount of memory allocated by &GAP; is 24 MBytes.''
  ``Under UNIX the default amount is 256 MBytes.''
  (Is it reasonable at all to mention the values in the text,
  i.e., wouldn't it be better to point to those components in `GAPInfo'
  where the current values --not only the default values-- can be looked up?
  Note for example that the script for starting GAP may involve a different
  default.)
  best: write a sentence that one should start GAP and look at GAPInfo.<something>!
  AK: removed defaults for -m and -o. The manual already refers to GAPInfo as
  to the source of such information.
+2*MN The section `Command Line Options' mentions GASMAN, malloc, sbrk,
  and the GAP compiler; is this still correct?
  --> I have looked at this, all is still correct.
      Or do we want to withdraw the compiler for 4.5? I think not!
+6AK Should the command line options be sorted alphabetically?
+6AK The section about the Mac mentions menus; should the menu entries be
  marked using <C> elements (as currently) or better using <B> elements?
  AK: this is ignored since the whole section about MacOS was removed.
+2AK The section about the Mac states
  ``Presently, &GAP; for MacOS also supports Mac path names, but this may
  change in the future.'' --what is the status here?
  AK: this is ignored since the whole section about MacOS was removed.
+1*TB Is the file `.gaprc' really read *after* `lib/init.g'?
  We have to change and document the setup.
  [This has been done as a part of the recent startup rearrangement.]
+1TB If it is really still meaningful to support both GAP 3 and GAP 4 in one's
  `.gaprc' file, why is such a complicated example needed?
  Reading one of the two files depending on some distinguishing value
  would be natural, so why should one use `Exec' and `echo', and then read
  a file `/tmp/jJj'?
  (And why is the alternative restricted to UNIX systems? Very strange!)
  [This has been done as a part of the recent startup rearrangement.]
+3c*TB I would say that using a workspace should be the recommended way
  to speed up the startup of GAP.
  This chapter, however, advertises completion fles (``reduce the startup
  time of &GAP; drastically''), and the section on workspaces does not
  mention the speedup at all.

 Proposal: Move the section on completion files to the end of chapter 3 and 
 bring the section on saving a workspace earlier. Add text recommending saving 
 a workspace and saying that completion files may be withdrawn in the future.
 
  [Chapter 3 has been rearranged according to the proposal.]
+1AK Why ``The most tempting code to compile is probably the library''?
  change descr. of GAC: used only for compiling kernel modules from C code in
  packages; put this into a chapter on developing packages
  AK: - Sections on suitability for compilation and compiling the library code
        moved to the GAP.dev manual.
      - The rest of the GAC description moved to the chapter on developing 
        packages, revised and restricted to cover only kernel modules.
-5 In the future, the Example package may also contain an example of the 
   kernel module and the documentation of the parts of the kernel interface 
   (some of which is already documented in the GAP.dev manual)
+1SL: check how gac works with GMP when GAP code being compiled 
  contains large integers (the solution would be to generate four #ifdefs
  for various modes (32/64-bit, with/without gmp). Done: fixed by Steve.
-5 cross-ref. to undocumented `READ_GAP_ROOT'.
+1TB Admit loading packages that have been installed newly after the GAP
  session started; in particular, admit loading packages that are not
  known in a given workspace!
  [This has been done as a part of the recent startup rearrangement.]

% Comments:
-6 Turn the various lists of special words into tables?
  Or better make them accessible as lists of GAP strings?
-5 What exactly is a keyword?  The statement that this is ``a reserved word''
  in section ``Symbols'' does not say anything.
  And after an explicit list of ``the'' keywords,
  another list of ``keywords because of technical reasons'' is shown,
  which is confusing.
  Also confusing is the statement:  ``The only consequence of this is that
  those identifiers cannot be re-assigned, and ...''
  However, we have also the feature that ordinary identifiers can be
  protected from overwriting, so this is not a meaningful criterion.
-5 In section ``Identifiers'', it is emphasized that `\*' is an identifier
  and not a keyword.
  This suggests that `*' in fact is a keyword. Is it?
+2AK Another confusing topic:  On the one hand, it is stated that keywords
  cannot be used as identifiers, but on the other hand, the function
  `IsValidIdentifier' returns `true' for the input `"if"'.
  (If there is a finite list of keywords then having this as a list stored in
  a component of `GAPInfo' would make it possible to use it in
  `IsValidIdentifier'.  And also code for improving GAPDoc documents could
  benefit from that.)
  This information is now provided by a kernel function ALL_KEYWORDS,
  so IsValidIdentifier can be updated. SL (AK: IsValidIdentifier updated,
  now returns `false' for `"if"'; manual has been updated, now the list 
  of keywords is produced from newly added GAPInfo.Keywords component. 
-5 Once again identifiers:
  ``An identifier usually consists ...'' is not a sensible formulation for a
  definition, which one expects in the section ``Identifiers''.
  (There are several such vague formulations where precise statements would
  be desirable.)
-6 Several sections show syntax constructs which cannot be expressed using
  <ManSection> (and <A>) elements, for example `<A>function-var</A>()',
  `<A>left-expr</A> = <A>right-expr</A>', `<A>procedure-var</A>();'.
  How to deal with this?
  (Moreover, there are some cases where the ``declaration line'' does not
  fit onto one line.)
-6 Section ``For'' contained a piece of pseudo code, distinguishing
  keywords and constants from variable names.
  How to write this in GAPDoc?
-5 What is the `continue' statement good for?
  (At least the example shown is not striking.)
+5*MN Is the comparison with PASCAL up-to-date?
  (several occurrences; replace by self-contained descriptions,
  without referring to PASCAL or so!)
  --> Done.
-5 The section ``The Syntax in BNF'' was commented out.
  (``A few recent additions to the syntax may be missing from this definition.''
  What is a definition good for that is by definition not correct?
  And the table in this section is too long; the lower part is not visible,
  and one gets a lot of LaTeX error messages when processing the manual.)
  It would still be desirable to have a correct definition of the GAP syntax.

  (There is also the undocumented function `DisplayString'.)

 TODO: write the proposal and discuss in gap-dev: 
   Display > ViewObj > PrintObj > DisplayString > ViewString > String
   may delegate only to things after you in this order. For very large objects
   makes sense have a PrintObj method as well as String to save memory.
 --> This is done and documented. Discussion on gap-dev needed.
 --> Proposal sent.
 --> Additional question: Do we really want that a name of an object
     overwrites the PrintObj methods??? Perhaps it should overwrite ViewObj
     and not PrintObj

+2AK The variables `last', `last2', `last3' are documented in the Tutorial,
  there is an index entry for `last' in the section ``Main Loop''
  but nothing else in the Reference Manual about `last', `last2', `last3'.
  These variables should get a proper documentation in the Reference Manual.
  AK: there is already an example in this section involving all `last', 
  `last2' and `last3'. I've added index entries for `last2', `last3' to
  the reference manual.
-5AK Section ``View and Print'' ends with a paragraph on `SetName'.
  But this function is documented in Chapter ``Objects and Elements''.
+3cAK Can someone explain why ``DownEnv moves *up* nr steps''?
  (The statements about this are confusing, so they do not fit into a Reference
  Manual.) 
  This is clarified now, using output of Where as mnemonic.
  Also heading is used for better ManSection title.
+3cMN Section ``Editor Support'':  Why is the following statement commented out?
  ``Send comments  and suggestions to Frank.Luebeck@Math.RWTH-Aachen.De''
  (Better suggest to contact support@gap-system.org also for these issues?)
 Agreed.
+5FL Infos on command line history is now available with
     '?The command line history'
     including new commands to save and read the history.
  Is section ``Line Editing'' still correct?
  E. g., is the command line history really limited to about 8000 characters?
  An easy tests shows that 8000 characters is not a limit, but it's not clear
  if a bigger limit exists (AK removed 8000 limit already, asked Frank for 
  further updates)
+3cMN  Shouldn't the global variable `EDITOR' be turned into a component of
  `GAPInfo'? YES
   (Document the default for `EDITOR'?
  Does it make sense to suggest `/usr/ucb/vi'?)
  GAPInfo.EDITOR should default to the environment variable $EDITOR and
  probably to fail (or something that gives a sane error message) otherwise.

+3c ``At some time, an options predicate or something of the kind may be added
  to method selection.''
  Is this still intended?  NO -- remove
  Explain that (currently) options are ignored by the method selection;
  only arguments of the function call are evaluated by the method selection.
   NO NEED

+3cMN Clarified.
 ``An alternative to this system is the use of additional optional arguments
  in procedure calls. This is not felt to be adequate because many procedure
  calls might cause, for example, a coset enumeration and each would need to
  make provision for the possibility of extra arguments. In this system the
  options are pushed when the user-level procedure is called, and remain in
  effect (unless altered) for all procedures called by it.''

  This is misleading: Additional optional arguments ARE used in most places,
  and in fact they are a clean way to transfer parameters to subroutines,
  whereas global options are in danger to be overwritten by someone else
  who tries to use the same mechanism.
  (I think optional arguments should be preferred to global options whenever
  one designs new code.)
  In my eyes, global options are a convenience not for the user but only for
  the programmer, in the situation that (s)he wants to carry a new parameter
  from a top level function to a low level function (a new method, say)
  without changing the intermediate function calls.
  The best reason for using global options in such a situation is that one
  simply cannot change the existing GAP library code that does not know about
  the new parameter.

(I admit that I do not like global options at all, in particular the
extended function call syntax.
In my eyes, this mechanism works only because it is used rarely.
If it will become more popular then eventually it will break its own
functionality.)

-4 `IsInternalRep' is mentioned but not documented.
-6   These and the next point could be done with Subsections  and some
     sensible Index entries. 
     Actually, 'list[ pos ]' is a shortcut for '\[\](list, pos)'  which
     can be documented with a standard ManSection. (Similar for the other
     cases below.) (FL)
     Looking at that Chapter, maybe this point can be marked +?
  GAPDoc issue: 
  In the section ``List Elements'', the notation `list[ pos ]' is
  introduced, which cannot be used in `ManSection';
  how to write this down?.
  Similar questions arise with `list{ poss }', `list[ pos ] := object',
  or `list1 = list2', `list1 <> list2', `list1 < list2', `list1 <= list2'.
-6 GAPDoc issue:
  The `ManSections' about `IsBound' and `Unbind' for lists show the argument
  `list[n]', which can be interpreted as a contradiction to the syntax for
  optional arguments.
  (GAPDoc turns this into list[, n] --viewed as optional argument!)
  (The optimal solution would be to introduce, recommend, and document
  a two-argument syntax for these operations.)
+2AK The documented function COPY_LIST_ENTRIES should not be written with
  capital letters only (and the declaration line is too long, and looks ugly).
  Declared a synonym and used shorter argument names in the manual.
+2*AH,AK very long lines in examples in ``Comparisons of Lists''
  What is the recommended line length for manual examples?
  Immediate in-place fix done.
  It turns out that 79 characters is the maximum possible in the PDF
  version and 75 for the online version. In HTML this depends on the
  size of the browser window.
  (This was done by Frank on a systematic basis)
-5 There is a section title ``Comparisons of Lists'' and an index entry
  ``comparisons!of lists'' (i.e., ``of lists'' is a subkey);
  the idea behind the index entry is that several subkeys will appear
  under the index entry ``comparisons''.
  A side-effect is that the online help finds two matches, one for the
  section and one for the index entry, which point to the same place.
  How to deal with this?
+3c*MN It is confusing to use `last' as the name of an argument, but this
  occurred in some functions for ranges;
  which better name could be used?
  Also, should we better generally *forbid* assigning to `last', `last2' etc.?
  (Also `rec' should not be used as the name of an argument in the
  documentation; GAP does not admit `rec' as an argument name!)
  And should `last', `rec', and other dangerous names be forbidden in
  <A> elements?
  Yes, replace it.
  Done for rec. We keep "last" since it does not show up in Arg="..."
  but only in constructions like [<A>first</A>..<A>last</A>] which
  is OKish.
  Leave the decision whether it is forbidden in GAPDoc to the GAPDoc
  authors.
-5 If ranges will be generalized in GAP 4.5,
  the restrictions on bounds and length of ranges have to be dropped.
  Yes, adjust the documentation once this is actually implemented.
+3c `PositionSorted':  The old documentation contained the statement
  ``we catch plain lists by a function to avoid method selection'',
  which I think was not intended for the manual and therefore was removed.
  Make it a comment to the code rather a comment to the documentation.
+2AK `PositionSortedOp' is mentioned but not documented, 
  but actually there is a comment in the PositionSorted section. 
  AK: added index entry for PositionSortedOp
+2*FL GAPDoc problem:  Entering `?List' now opens the entry for GAPDoc's <List>
  element (the only exact match since the function `List' now has two
  variants with labels)
  [This is also a problem for `IsDocumentedFunction'.]
  (MN to ask Frank)
-6 `ListX' documentation:
  how to write down formatted/indented pseudo code, with comments
  in ordinary text, with <M> and <A> elements etc.
-3 `lists.xml' contains a section ``More about Sets'' from the GAP 3.4 manual
  that was commented out already in the 4.4 manual.
  What to do with this text?
  --> Take out the relevant parts of this and put it into section
      "Sorted Lists and Sets"
      However: Do we want to document the TNUM business storing
      denseness and sortedness???
+3c (AH) The sentence ``Currently &GAP; uses shellsort.'' in section
  ``Sorting Lists'' looks strange.
  (In which *methods* is shellsort used?)
-5 Mentioned undocumented functions `UnionSet', `IntersectionSet' from 
   coll.gi, which are also methods for more general operations `Union' and
   `Intersection'. It may be worth to document them properly.
-3 why is IsRange a category not a property?
  (clean up IsRange vs. ConvertToRangeRep?)
  --> Fix together with the ranges.
      Note that IsRange on Plain lists works and can silently change
      the representation to range representation.
  --> Rethink when we have more general ranges.

+3cMN It is not reasonable that calling `IsBlist' silently changes a list to
  the compact blist representation; instead, there should be
  `ConvertToBlistRep'; `IsBlist' should just check, not convert.
  --> Yes, provide and document ConvertToBlistRep, visit all occurrences
  of IsBlist in the library to see whether they need to be changed

  ``the call to <C>ExampleActionFunction</C> implements the induced action
  of <A>G</A>'';
  I think this is nonsense, and have commented is out.
  (For example, there is no GAP function `ExampleActionFunction'.)
  AK: removed it completely
-3 `OnLines' and other action functions promise an error when the argument
  point is not normalized,
  but this is not true for `OnLines'.
  `OnSets' does not tell what happens if the argument set is not a set,
  but runs into an error in this case.
  1. I think that the predefined action functions should behave the same
     with respect to tests of the conditions on their arguments,
     and this should be documented consistently.
     (Currently there is a section ``Action on canonical representatives''
     *behind* the introduction of the action functions.)
  2. Aren't such tests an unnecessary overhead?
     (If we really want to have foolproof behaviour here, we could introcude
     `NC' variants, and change all the occurrences in the library ...)
-5* `Orbit': The action function is optional - this is now clear. 
    (The whole chapter should be checked for consistency.)
    We checked and stated the default value of action. May be improved by 
    cross-ref to the place where all other optional arguments (Omega, pnt, 
    gens, acts) are explained.
-4 `OrbitStabilizer' and `StabilizerOfExternalSet':
  What does the statement ``The stabilizer must have G as its parent.'' mean?
  The function *constructs* this stabilizer, so there is no requirement on
  the arguments, or?
  (And for `OrbitStabilizer', there is no description what the return value
  is ...)
  I have replaced the ``must'' by ``will'', as is used in the `Stabilizer'
  description.
  TODO: document the return value of OrbitStabilizer.
-6* GAPDoc issue:
  When a declaration line is too long, such as the first one for
  `ActionHomomorphism', then it is not left aligned in the PDF version.
  Can this be fixed easily?
-3 Is it really needed to call `ActionHomomorphism' with a result of
  `Action' (``for GAP 3 compatibility'')?
  In other words, is `Action' really required to store information about
  the arguments in its return value?
-3 `SparseActionHomomorphism': What does the sentence ``If G acts on a 
   very large domain Omega not surjectively'' mean?
  Is surjective here the same as transitive?
  (Several formulations in this chapter sound strange.)
-3 `ActorOfExternalSet': This works only if 
   `CanonicalRepresentativeDeterminatorOfExternalSet' is available, or?
-3 `IsTransitive': The definition does not assume that the group really 
  acts on the domain given. So for example the ``action on'' any singleton 
  set is always regarded as transitive. Is this a meaningful definition?

  ``the maximal degree of any permutation in &GAP; is

  confusing statement about the space requirement:

  <M>32</M>-bit integers (actually as &GAP; immediate integers less than
  <M>2^{28}</M>), depending on whether <M>d \leq 65536</M> or not.

  A nice example for `SmallerDegreePermutationRepresentation' (from regular
  representation of Sym(6) to natural representation) is commented out. Why?
+2AK There is the statement: ``There are no methods yet for IsSymmetricGroup
  and IsAlternatingGroup!'' Really?
  AK: removed it, there are methods (at least some).
+3bAH Yes.
  Is the reference <Cite Key="eickhulpkeXX"/> (up to now commented out)
  meanwhile available?
+1*AH: changed text
  Statement about stabilizer chain records:
  ``This gives a recursive structure where the <Q>outermost</Q> record
  representing the <Q>topmost</Q> stabilizer is bound to the group record
  component <C>stabChain</C> and has the components explained below.''
  The term ``group record component'' is wrong, it is a relic from GAP 3.
  And the term ``topmost stabilizer'' is either wrong or at least misleading,
  since the chain given by `StabChain' represents the group itself and not
  the stabilizer of the first base point.
  (In GAP 3, the situation was different: The group record itself had
  components `base' and `orbit', and the component `stabChain' represented
  the stabilizer of the first point in the `orbit' component.)
  The rest of the text should be checked for more such wrong statements.
+5AK The list label ``limit (default Size( Parent( G ) ) or StabChainOptions(
  Parent( G ) ).limit if this is present'' is too long!
+2 Description of the component `orbit': How shall the sentence 
   ``ordered in such a way that the base point b_i is'' end?
+1AH `GroupStabChain':
  cross-reference to `Generators( S )' and to ``assigned as component
  stabChain'' --relics from GAP 3?
  AH: commented out.
-4AK ``Working with large degree permutation groups'':
  Does it make sense to show a fake ``example'' of ``a group of degree
  231000'', where the input data (the generators) are not described?
  Would it be sensible to have the full example somewhere on the GAP
  web pages, and to refer to this from the Reference Manual?
  (This would be possible also in other cases.)
  TODO: add a sentence about the file structure. If possible, provide
  the file on the GAP pages and put URL in the manual. The concept makes
  sense, it shows straight line programs, so it's really useful example.

  the methods for polycyclic groups can only be applied to finite groups.
  However, a more general implementation is planned.'', as follows:
  - State that the pc group methods are applicable to permutation groups and
    matrix groups that are  known to be solvable, and that the methods are
    especially efficient for groups whose elements are represented w.r.t. a
    pc presentation (crossref. to the chapter in question).
    Perhaps add a *VERY SHORT* remark about the different situation in GAP 3,
    for example via ``contrary to GAP 3'', but this should not be very
    prominent; in fact I would completely omit it.
  - Can the last two sentences be replaced by a reference to the package

  common example for several subsections; split this?
+3cBE,AK Induced pcgs are defined in Section 45.7, but several earlier subsections
  require their arguments to be induced pcgs;
  should te ordering be changed, or would it be sufficient to add
  cross-references? (AK: added cross-references)
+3cBE,AK `SpecialPcgs':
  The code (but not the documentation) contains a statement that any method
  installed for a group as the only argument should delegate to the method
  for a pcgs.  This means that nobody should install another method for this
  situation.  Shouldn't this become documented? (BE: I guess that thought 
  that this is not of interest. I still think it is probably not of interest)

  to ignore this, so `doc/ref/module.tex' contains the documentation;
  I have now added it also to the 4.dev documentation.
  AK: No methods installed in the library and packages. Removed.
+4AK Several statements talk about ``scalars''.
  It should be made precise what this means for a given module.
  AK: added a note: here and below by scalars we mean elements of a domain 
  acting on <A>D</A> from left or right as appropriate.
-5 The whole chapter is suitable at most for the case of (left) vector spaces,
  and all examples deal with that context.
  In fact there is few support for more general situations,
  even for Z-modules.
  GAP is almost useless for dealing with R-modules where R is a ring that
  is not a field and not Z.
  And the distinction between left modules w.r.t. scalar action and right
  modules w.r.t. an algebra action (e.g., via matrices on row vectors)
  is not described.

-5 Are `NumeratorOfRationalFunction', `DenominatorOfRationalFunction' as
  independent attributes a meaningful concept,
  that is, shouldn't the information better be stored in a pair?
  Indeed, but for compatibility we must retain the existing setup.
-5 `LeadingMonomial':
  ``returns the leading monomial (with respect to the ordering given by
  MonomialExtGrlexLess''
  Wouldn't it be more sensible to admit an ordering as optional second
  argument?

  (I would vote for avoiding the one-letter variable name,
  and eventually get rid of the operation name `X'.)
  AK: replaced X by Indeterminate in manual examples and code. Left it 
  only in the mansection for Indeterminate where X is documented as a 
  synonym. Suggestion to move X to obsoletes and withdraw it from the

  ``It returns the empty string if pol is 0.'' --Why a string?
  (And isn't the empty list an obvious result,
  why is it useful to state this prominently?)
  AK: Fixed, returns empty list. Still useful to document.

+3 First of all:
  Does it make sense to put a chapter on the installation into the
  Reference Manual?
  (If one is able to read this chapter in one's own installation then
  the installation has worked.
  And the web version that can be read before the installation need not be
  part of the Reference Manual.)
  AK,MN et al. - this makes sense.
  AK: the chapter has been removed (16/09/2011). Some parts were re-used
  elsewhere. The plan is to have a single INSTALL document on Web and in
  the GAP root directory.
+3bAK Is the statement correct that there is no installer program?
  (We have two alternative installers for Windows and one alternative 
  installter for Mac OS X.) 
  AK: changed it to "there may be no installer program".
+2AK Are the required disk space and main memory mentioned up to date?
+2AK Is the statement correct that there is no Upgrade mode?
  AK: removed that sentence.
+3bAH NO
  Is the `htmie4r5p0' archive still needed,
  i.e., do we still have to mention old versions of browsers such as
  Internet Explorer which had difficulties with rendering Unicode correctly?
+3cAK Should ``Mozilla'' be replaced by ``Firefox''? (yes, replaced)
+3cTB The former chapter ``Migrating to  GAP4'' is mentioned (but not via a
  cross-reference, so one had to read the text for finding it ...).
  Should this better be removed completely?
  (removed the paragraph that addresses users with GAP 3 experience, i.e.,
  the statements about Migrating to GAP 4 and the compatibility mode)
+3AK Is it really necessary to discuss that there is no reason to print out
  the Reference Manual?
  (Yes, why not - as an extra reference to the Tutorial).
+1AK,JJM Installation instructions still refers to zoo archives, explains how 
   to get GAP for Mac OS and does not reflect recent changes in the build
   process (gmp and readline options) - this should be cleaned up.
+1AK Related issue: update number of GAP4stones in testinstall.g and testall.g
   (a preliminary update has been already made by AK after GAP 4.5.2, do
   another one before the final release)

+3a There is a remark: ``Categories and representations should not be 
  operations, the same for filters made by <C>NewFilter</C>!''
  (Done - now everything is displayed properly).
+3a Is the section ``External Representation'' really of interest?
  That is, where is this concept really used?
  Yes, this is useful.
+3a Is it really necessary to distinguish `DeclareGlobalFunction' and
  `DeclareGlobalVariable'? (Answer: YES)
  (In fact the implementation looks different.)
  The code contains the following statement:
  `` Global functions of the GAP library must be distinguished from other
  global variables (see variable.g) because of the completion mechanism.''
  Is this really true?
  Can't the system decide whether a variable is a function or not?
+3aMN We could get rid of `DeclareSynonymAttr' by checking in `DeclareSynonym'
  whether the variable in question is actually an attribute,
  and if yes then binding also the globals for its setter and its tester.
  Done: However: keep DeclareSynonymAttr in the library because it is
                 valuable information in the code and provides
                 backward compatibility, withdraw documentation 
  Completely reverted: Various uses in the library and packages make

  AK: said that it is also possible to re-declare an operation with another 
  number of arguments and/or different filters for its arguments.
-5* In ``Enforcing Property Tests'', one finds ``As mentioned above''.
  This is not very useful if one does not assume that someone reads the
  whole book.  So we should try to avoid such formulations, and to give
  explicit references instead.
  (This is of course a general statement for the whole documentation.)
+3aAK Section ``Adding a new Operation'' starts with ``The next step''
  --what does this refer to? (AK: reformulated)
+3aAK Section ``Components versus Attributes'' is not appropriate.
  For example, the aspect that the knowledge of attribute values can be
  used in the method selection is not mentioned.
  (And why do attributes need *two* filter bits?)
  AK: mentioned method selection, and changed to *one* filter bit
+5AK It should be stated which of the examples shown in the chapter are
  ``ficticious'' (not part of the GAP library) and which are taken from
  the library.
  For example, there is an example which introduces a new property
  `IsMGroup', whereas the GAP library uses the similar but different filter
  `IsMonomial'.

  is not correct.

+3aAK Will revision entries in the format as created by cvs be supported
  also in the forthcoming library files? AK: not all version control systems
  support this. DisplayRevision will not make sense without revision numbers

+2 Please confirm the status of the following:
  This chapter does not fit into a GAP 4 Tutorial,
  therefore it has been removed from it.
  I propose to turn the chapter into a self-contained document
  that is available only in the GAP 3 part of the GAP website,
  in PDF and HTML format. (A preliminary version is `doc/migratedoc.tex'; 
  shorten the copyright notice?)
+3a The only part of this chapter that is interesting for GAP 4 users
  is the section on ``Naming Conventions''.
  Put it somewhere?
  (Or is the contents already available somewhere else?)
  AK: placed it in the ``Functions'' chapter of the Reference Manual,
  documented also "As" and "With" conventions, added more cross-references.

+3AK Please confirm the status of the following:
  It does not make sense to have a GAPDoc version of this chapter;
  note that it is self-referential.
  I propose to turn the chapter into a self-contained document
  that is available in the GAP website, in PDF and HTML format.
  (A preliminary version is `doc/gapmacrodoc.tex';
  shorten the copyright notice?)
  AK: this document is now supplied with GAP in the tools archive.
+3AK The text refers to the ``manual checker tools'', to the ``manual builder'',
  and to the ``HTML converter''. The relevant code and its documentation 
  should be kept in the same place as this chapter. Or should we just throw 
  this away? (Which packages do still need this stuff?)
  AK: Some packages may need it, keep it at least for now in the tools archive.
