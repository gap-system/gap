!! Type of Change
Fix: wrong result

!! Description
An AsList method was installed for prime fields which did not work
correctly for the field of rational numbers. As a consequence,
AsList(Rationals) would return the string "TRY_NEXT_METHOD". This
incorrect behavior has been around for a long time. With this change, it
now produces an error as it should.

! Test Code
gap> AsList(Rationals);
Error, cannot compute elements list of infinite domain <V>

!! Changeset
lib/field.gi

!! End
