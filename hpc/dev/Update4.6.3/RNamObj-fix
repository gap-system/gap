!! Type of Change
Fix: inappropriate error message

!! Description
A bug in the GAP kernel caused RNamObj to error out when called with a
string that had the IsSSortedList property set (regardless of whether it
was set to true or false). This in turn would lead to strange (and
inappropriate) errors when using such a string to access entries of a
record.

! Test Code
gap> s:="cba";
"cba"
gap> IsSSortedList(s);
false
gap> IsInt(RNamObj(s));
true
gap> r:=rec(cba := 1);;
gap> IsBound(r.(s));
true

!! Changeset
src/records.c

!! End
