!! Type of Change
Fix: efficiency issue

!! Description
Two new PerfectResiduum methods were added for solvable
and perfect groups, handling these cases optimally.
Moreover, the existing generic method was improved by
changing it to use DerivedSeriesOfGroup. Previously,
it would always compute the derived series from scratch
and then throw away the result.

!! Changeset
lib/grplatt.gi

!! End
