!! Type of Change
Fix: crash

!! Description
A bug in the code for accessing sublist via the list{poss} syntax could
lead to GAP crashing. Specifically, if the list was a compressed vector
over a finite field, and the sublist syntax was nested, as in
vec{poss1}{poss2}. This now correctly triggers an error instead of
crashing.

This fixes issue #312.

! Test Code
gap> v:=IdentityMat(28,GF(2))[1];
<a GF2 vector of length 28>
gap> v{[1..Length(v)]}{[1..5]};
Error, List Elements: <lists> must be a list (not a object (data))

!! Changeset
src/lists.c

!! End
