%%  This file is intended to list the changes that will be published with
%%  the next update of GAP.
%%  The information is used for producing the announcement of the update,
%%  the additions to `tst/bugfix.tst', and an HTML page that lists the
%%  known bugs and intended new features.
%%
%%  For adding a change, just copy one of the templates below to the end of the
%%  file, and enter the relevant information.
%%
%%  Formal rules for this file, to allow simple parsing by a script:
%%          - lines starting with `%' are comments and are ignored
%%          - lines starting with `!' describe the type of information
%%            in the following lines until the next `!'-line
%%          - each entry must be finished with an `! End' line, otherwise
%%            the order of entries is irrelevant
%%          - the text behind the `!' is case and whitespace insensitive
%%
