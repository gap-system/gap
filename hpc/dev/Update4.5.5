%%  This file is intended to list the changes that will be published with
%%  the next update of GAP.
%%  The information is used for producing the announcement of the update,
%%  the additions to `tst/bugfix.tst', and an HTML page that lists the
%%  known bugs and intended new features.
%%
%%  For adding a change, just copy one of the templates below to the end of the
%%  file, and enter the relevant information.
%%
%%  Formal rules for this file, to allow simple parsing by a script:
%%          - lines starting with `%' are comments and are ignored
%%          - lines starting with `!' describe the type of information
%%            in the following lines until the next `!'-line
%%          - each entry must be finished with an `! End' line, otherwise
%%            the order of entries is irrelevant
%%          - the text behind the `!' is case and whitespace insensitive
%%

Fix: infinite recursion
! Description
Fixed an old bug in CommutatorSubgroup for fp groups. It was causing
infinite recursions, and could for example also be triggered by computing
automorphism groups.
! Test Code
gap> F:=FreeGroup(3);;
gap> G:=F/[F.1^2,F.2^2,F.3^2,(F.1*F.2)^3, (F.2*F.3)^3, (F.1*F.3)^2];;
gap> U:=Subgroup(G, [G.3*G.1*G.3*G.2*G.1*G.3*G.2*G.3*G.1*G.3*G.1*G.3]);;
gap> StructureDescription(CommutatorSubgroup(G, U));
"C2 x C2"
gap> StructureDescription(AutomorphismGroup(G));

Fix: crash
! Description
For small primes (compact fields) ZmodnZObj(r,p) now returns the
corresponding FFE to avoid crashes when compacting matrices.
! Test Code
gap> gens:=[[[1,1],[0,1]], [[1,0],[1,1]]] * ZmodnZObj(1,7);
[ [ [ Z(7)^0, Z(7)^0 ], [ 0*Z(7), Z(7)^0 ] ], [ [ Z(7)^0, 0*Z(7) ], [ Z(7)^0, Z(7)^0 ] ] ]

Fix: internal data corruption
! Description
Previously, the list of factors of a polynomial was mutable, and hence could
be accidentally corrupted by callers. Now the list of irreducible factors 
is stored immutable. To deal with implicit reliance on old code, always a
shallow copy is returned.
! Test Code
gap> rng := PolynomialRing(Rationals, ["x","y"]);
Rationals[x,y]
gap> ind := IndeterminatesOfPolynomialRing(rng);
[ x, y ]
gap> x := ind[1];
x
gap> y := ind[2];
y
gap> pol:=5*(x+1)^2 ;
5*x^2+10*x+5
gap> factors := Factors(pol);
[ 5*x+5, x+1 ]
gap> factors[2] := y;
y
gap> factors[1] := [];
[  ]
gap> Factors( pol ); #bug
[ 5*x+5, x+1 ]

Fix: library function to work with package objects
! Description
Computing high powers of matrices ran into an error for matrices in the
format of the <span class="package">cvec</span> package. Now the library
function also works with these matrices.
! Test Code
gap> mat := [[Z(2)]];;
gap> ConvertToMatrixRep(mat,2);
2
gap> cmat := CMat(mat);
<cmat 1x1 over GF(2,1)>
gap> cmat^1000;

Fix: allow more than 128 subprocesses on certain systems
! Description
Partially rewrote the pseudo tty code which is responsible for spawning
subprocesses. This mechanism is for example used by anupq and nq to
compute group quotients via an external program. Previously, on Mac OS X
this could be done precisely 128 times, and then an error would occur.
That is, you could e.g. compute 128 nilpotent quotients, and then you had
to restart gap to compute more.
This also affected other systems, such as OpenBSD, where it now also works
correctly.
! Test Code
gap> LoadPackage("anupq");
true
gap> for i in [1..192] do Q := Pq( FreeGroup(2) : Prime := 3, ClassBound := 1 ); od;

Fix: avoid a bug in GNU readline 6.2
! Description
On Mac OS X, using a gap compiled against GNU readline 6.2, pasting text
into the terminal session would result in this text appearing very slowly,
with a 0.1 sec delay between each "keystroke". This is not the case with
versions 6.1 and older, and has been reported to the GNU readline team. In
the meantime, we work around this issue in most situations by setting
rl_event_hook only if OnCharReadHookActive is set.

Fix: configuration
! Description
The CTblLib and TomLib packages are removed from the list of suggested
packages of the core part of GAP. Instead they are added to the default list
of the user preference "PackagesToLoad". This way it is possible to
configure GAP to not load these packages via changing the default value
of "PackagesToLoad".

Fix: failed GAP start
! Description
GAP did not start correctly if the user preference "InfoPackageLoadingLevel"
was set to a number >= 3. The reason is that PrintFormattedString
was called before it was installed. The current fix is a temporary solution.

Fix: wrong result
! Description
The function <span class="code">IsDocumentedWord</span> tested the given word
against strings obtained by splitting help matches at non-letter characters.
This way, variable names containing underscores or digits were erroneously
not regarded as documented,
and certain substrings of these names were erroneously regarded as documented.
! Test Code
gap> IsDocumentedWord( "d" );
false
gap> # "d_N" is documented
gap> IsDocumentedWord( "last2" );
true
gap> # in the earlier version, the match 'last2' had been replaced by 'last'
gap> # before the comparison
