!! Type of Change
Fix: inappropriate error message

!! Description

Syntax errors such as Unbind(x,1) had the unhelpful
property that x got unbound before the syntax error
was reported. Add a specific check to catch this and
similar cases a little earlier

! Test Code
gap> l := [1,2,3];;
gap> Unbind(l,1);
Syntax error: 'Unbind': argument should be followed by ')' in stream line 1
Unbind(l,1);
        ^
gap> l;
[ 1, 2, 3 ]
! Prefetch

!! Changeset
