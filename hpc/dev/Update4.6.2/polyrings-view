! Type of Change
New: improved output
! Description
Replaced ViewObj method for fields by ViewString method to improve the way
how polynomial rings over algebraic extenstions of fields are displayed.
! Test Code
gap> R:=PolynomialRing(GF(5),"mu");;
gap> mu:=Indeterminate(GF(5));;
gap> T:=AlgebraicExtension(GF(5),mu^5-mu+1);;
gap> A:=PolynomialRing(T,"x");
<field of size 3125>[x]
