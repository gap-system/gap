! Type of Change
Fix: wrong result

! Description
DefaultScalarDomainOfMatrixList was introduced in GAP 4.5.6 but
contained a small bug that could result in it returning incorrect
results if the given list contained compressed matrices.

! Test Code
gap> m:=IdentityMat(8,GF(3));;
gap> m2:=m + List([1..8],i->List([1..8], j->Zero(GF(3))));;
gap> DefaultScalarDomainOfMatrixList([m,m2]);
GF(3)
gap> DefaultScalarDomainOfMatrixList([m2,m]);
GF(3)

! Changeset
lib/grpffmat.gi
! End
