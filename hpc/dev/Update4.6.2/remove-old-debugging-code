! Type of Change
Fix: crash

! Description

The extremely old DEBUG_DEADSONS_BAGS compile-time
option has not worked correctly for many years and indeed crashes GAP.

The type of bug it is there to detect has not arisen in many years and we 
have certainly not used this option. Easiest thing is just to delete it.
It can be rebuilt, or recovered from Mercurial if needed.
