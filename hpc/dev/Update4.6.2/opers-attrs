New: extended functionality

!! Description

It is now possible to declare a name as an Operation with 
two or more arguments (possibly several times) and THEN declare
it as Attribute. Previously this was only possible in the other order.

This should make the system more independent of the order in which
packages are loaded.

! Test Code
gap> DeclareOperation("MyOp",[IsObject, IsObject]);
gap> DeclareAttribute("MyOp",IsObject);
! Prefetch

!! Changeset

!! End
