      Setting up the (Linux) rsync distribution
      =========================================

## (C) Frank LÃ¼beck

(0) Following http://freegamedev.net/wiki/Portable_binaries we setup virtual
    machines with Ubuntu Dapper (6.06 LTS) for i686 and AMD64 for linking
    against sufficiently old glibc (2.3).
       (virtual machines are currently started on gemma:
         VBoxHeadless -s dapper606x8664  # 137.226.152.52
         VBoxHeadless -s dapper606386    # 137.226.152.51
         VBoxHeadless -s GAPrsync        # 137.226.152.50
       )

(1) Choose a directory RSDIR, copy the files motd, rsyncd.conf and
    startrsyncserver to RSDIR, and adjust the paths in 'rsyncd.conf' 
    (search 'home2').

(2) Fetch newest archive from ftp://ftp.gap-system.org/pub/{gappre or gap/gap}:
    gap4r*p*.tar.gz

(3) Copy archives to native i686 machine and call in that directory on that
    machine  'gapsync/InstForRsync32' (currently GAP is build in ~/build45
    with the local script './inst').

(4) Similarly, copy archives to x86_64 machine. For 'homology' package also 
    copy the archive homology.1.4.5.staticbin.tgz to the same place.
    Then call 'gapsync/InstForRsync64' (also currently in ~/build45 via
    local script './inst').

(5) Create $RSDIR/gap/linux and in there call 'gapsync/CollectDistribution'
    (after checking/adjusting paths in CollectDistribution).
    This first copies the new version into a subdirectory 'gap4r5XXX'.
    One can start 'startrsyncserverXXX' and test the updated version.
    If all is fine rename directories with local script 'swapwithXXX' and
    stop the XXX rsync server.

(6) Adjust index.html, rsyncserv.css, CHANGES and motd (in repository 
    and $RSDIR). 

(7) Copy index.html, rsyncserv.css, CHANGES to website. 
 cp index.html rsyncserv.css CHANGES ~/MyWWWHome/web/~Frank.Luebeck/gap/rsync/
    Start rsync server with 'startrsyncserver' in $RSDIR. 
    [An entry '@reboot $RSDIR/startrsyncserver' is sensible.]

(8) That's it.

(9) For updates/improvements: 
        - adjust scripts in 'gapsync/' 
        - repeat steps (2)-(4)
        - adjust in (5) CollectDistribution to copy changes only
          (e.g., use an exclude file to avoid syncing of new executables
          which actually have not changed)
        - do (6) (in particular CHANGES), commit, and copy changed files 
          to website
