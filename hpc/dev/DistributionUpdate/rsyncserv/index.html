&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<a href="CHANGES">Details</a>)
</p>
<p>
This is a binary distribution of <span class="pkg">GAP</span>&nbsp;4.7
on Linux PCs with i686 or x86_64 compatible processors (Pentium, Athlon, 
Xeon, Opteron, ...). 
It is maintained by <a
href="http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~Frank.Luebeck">Frank Lübeck</a>.
Any reports or suggestions are welcome.
</p>

<p>
The idea is to install <span class="pkg">GAP</span> on Linux by syncronizing 
via the internet with a reference installation. Some features are:
</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="pkg">GAP</span> is already compiled with GMP and readline
support. Binaries are linked such that only the C-library of any
distribution from the last 5 years is needed at runtime.</li>
<li>For 64-bit systems binaries in 32-bit mode and in 64-bit mode are
provided.
See <a href="#32versus64">below</a> for further
remarks.
</li>
<li>Almost all distributed packages are fully installed, this is the main 
point which
makes installation much easier compared to a  direct installation  from 
the sources.
</li>
<li>
Installation is by choosing a directory and two easy commands, as explained
below (ok, some packages need other external software, see below). 
</li>
<li>
Upgrades can be done by one simple command. They are very fast and save
network bandwidth.
</li>
<li>
...
</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Get <span class="pkg">GAP</span> via this Service</h2>
<p>
(and not directly from the <a
href="http://www.gap-system.org/Download/">
<span class="pkg">GAP</span> site</a>.)
</p>

<p>
You need: a machine with PC architecture (i686 or x86_64 compatible) 
running under 
<a href="http://www.linux.org">Linux</a>, a directory with about 1600&nbsp;MB of
free space and the <code>rsync</code> program (if you don't have
<code>rsync</code>, there is certainly a package with this name in your
Linux distribution).
</p>

<p>
Then copy the start script, called <code>gapsync</code>, into the current
directory using the following command (don't forget the trailing dot):
</p>
<pre>   rsync --port=8731 -azv rsync.gap-system.org::gap4r5/gapsync/gapsync .
</pre>
<p>
Now call this script:
</p>
<pre>   ./gapsync
</pre>
<p>
You are asked for two directories. The first is for the installation. 
Everything is copied into a subdirectory <code>gap4r5</code> of this directory
(the default is <code>/usr/local/lib</code>). The second directory should be
one in your standard path of executable programs, the scripts to start <span
class="pkg">GAP</span> will be put there (the default is
<code>/usr/local/bin</code>).
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> We will use the directory name <code>gap4r5</code>
also for the next <span
class="pkg">GAP</span> releases (4.6.x, 4.7.x and so on) such that updates
can be made more easily by calling the <code>gapsync</code> script.
</p>
<p>If some of these scripts exist already you will be asked if they can be
deleted. Move them away first if you want to keep them.
</p>
<p>After giving these two directories, answer <code>y</code> to the next
question to start the installation. Depending on your network connection
you can use <span class="pkg">GAP</span> after three to ... minutes (about
360&nbsp;MB must be transferred via the internet).
</p>

<h2>Upgrading from the <code>rsync</code> distribution of <span
class="pkg">GAP</span>&nbsp;4.4</h2>

<p>The <code>rsync</code> distribution for <span
class="pkg">GAP</span>&nbsp;4.4 will not automatically upgrade to <span
class="pkg">GAP</span>&nbsp;4.5. Please, follow the two step procedure
above to install <span class="pkg">GAP</span>&nbsp;4.5. 
</p>
<p>You can keep the <span
class="pkg">GAP</span>&nbsp;4.4 installation together with the new <span
class="pkg">GAP</span>&nbsp;4.5 for a while. In that case  you probably want 
to rename some of the 
start scripts for <span
class="pkg">GAP</span>&nbsp;4.4 before installing 4.5 (e.g., find them with 
<code>which gapL</code> and rename <code>gapL</code> to <code>gap44L</code>
or similar).
</p>
<p>You can remove your <span
class="pkg">GAP</span>&nbsp;4.4 installation with its <code>remove</code> 
script. Use the following command in a <span
class="pkg">GAP</span>&nbsp;4.4 session to find out how this script can be
called:
</p>
<pre>    Print(Concatenation(First(GAPInfo.RootPaths, p-&gt;
                    Filename([Directory(p)],"lib/init.g") <> fail), 
                    "/gapsync/remove\n"));
</pre>

<h2>How to call <span class="pkg">GAP</span></h2>
<p>
The following scripts are provided by this distribution:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>gapL</code></dt>
<dd>for calling <span class="pkg">GAP</span> with a saved workspace.
This is the recommended way to start <span class="pkg">GAP</span>, it
is much faster than calling <code>gap</code>.</dd>
<dt><code>gap</code></dt>
<dd>for calling <span class="pkg">GAP</span></dd>
<dt><code>gapsync</code></dt>
<dd>for updating this <span class="pkg">GAP</span> installation</dd>
<dt><code>xgap</code></dt>
<dd>for using <span class="pkg">GAP</span> via an X11 interface with graphical
capabilities (but no terminal capabilities in its main window). </dd>
<dt><code>pargap</code></dt>
<dd>for the variant of <span class="pkg">GAP</span> provided by the 
<span class="pkg">ParGAP</span> package, see the package documentation</dd>
<dt><code>gap64, gap64L, pargap64</code></dt>
<dd>(only on x86_64 based 64-bit architecture) the scripts above always call
the 32-bit version of <span class="pkg">GAP</span>, use these scripts to 
call the 64-bit version</dd>
<dt><code></code></dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>

<h2>Updating</h2>

<p>You can update the installation by calling the script
</p>
<pre>   gapsync
</pre>
<p>which was installed during initialization and mentioned above. The
syncronization will usually take just a few seconds. A new workspace is 
created after each syncronization locally.</p>
<p>An update should not be made while a <span class="pkg">GAP</span>
job is running. If you have long running jobs do not use an automatic, say
nightly, update.</p>

<h2>User customization</h2>
<p>Starting from <span class="pkg">GAP</span>&nbsp;4.5 the old
<code>~/.gaprc</code> file is substituted by a much more flexible setup. 
Instead of just this file a whole directory <code>~/.gap/</code> is used.
An easy way to make use of this is to call in a  
<span class="pkg">GAP</span>&nbsp;4.5 session the command
</p>
<pre>    WriteGapIniFile();
</pre>
<p>
This creates the <code>~/.gap/</code> directory (if necessary) and the file
<code>~/.gap/gap.ini</code>. Look into this file and adjust some of the
settings as you like (e.g., specify packages (not) to load, color prompt,
<code>less</code> as pager, ...). If your old <code>~/.gaprc</code>
contained code that is not covered by the configuration options in
<code>~/.gap/gap.ini</code>, then copy that code into the file 
<code>~/.gap/gaprc</code>.
</p>

<h2>Customization of this installation</h2>
<p>
You can customize the <code>gap</code>, <code>gap64</code>, <code>gapL</code>,
<code>gap64L</code>,
<code>gapsync</code> scripts by editing the files in the
<code>local/bin</code> subdirectory of this <span class="pkg">GAP</span>
installation.
</p>
<p>
You can customize the workspace used in your installation by copying
<code>gapsync/CreateWorkspace.sh</code> to
<code>local/bin/CreateWorkspace</code> (for 32-bit version) or
<code>local/bin/CreateWorkspace64</code> (for 64-bit version)
and editing the latter.
For example, you may want another set of packages preloaded.
</p>
<p>Additional packages can be installed in the <code>local/pkg</code>
subdirectory.
</p>
<p>Whenever you have changed something in the installation call
<code>gapsync</code> which will produce an updated workspace.
</p>
<p>
If you change things outside the <code>local</code> subdirectory they are
deleted with the next call of <code>gapsync</code>. If you find errors in
this part, please report them.
</p>

<h2>Removing this installation</h2>
<p>To remove this <span class="pkg">GAP</span> installation use the
script <code>remove</code> in the 
subdirectory <code>gapsync</code> of your installation:
</p>
<pre>   &lt;path to your installation&gt;/gapsync/remove
</pre>
<p>This just deletes the links to the  scripts mentioned above and the
whole installation directory (starting <code>gap4r5</code>), so including
any custom installations in the <code>gap4r5/local</code> subdirectory.
</p>
<p>You can also just delete or forget about the <code>gapsync</code> script
and use the installed <span class="pkg">GAP</span> like any standard
installation.
</p>

<h2>Notes on this installation, in particular packages</h2>
<p>The <span class="pkg">GAP</span> version is 4.5.6.</p>
<p>It is an installation of the archive <code>
~/tmp/gap4r5p6_2012_09_16-01_02.tar.gz
</code> plus version 1.4.5 of the <span class="pkg">homology</span> package.
</p>
<p>The packages 
<span class="pkg">Alnuth</span>, 
<span class="pkg">HAP</span>,
<span class="pkg">polymaking</span>, 
<span class="pkg">PolymakeInterface</span>
<span class="pkg">qaos</span>,
<span class="pkg">singular</span>,  
and 
<span class="pkg">SgpViz</span> 
need or suggest further 
external software, and may not work immediately with full functionality. 
More details: <a
href="http://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/pkg/Alnuth-3.0.0/htm/CHAP004.htm">Pari/GP</a>,
<a href="http://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/pkg/Hap1.10/README.hap">HAP</a>,
<a href="http://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/pkg/polymaking/doc/chap1.html#X8794FBB27B46C08E">polymaking</a>,
<a
href="http://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/pkg/qaos/doc/qaos.html#SEC2">qaos</a>,
<a
href="http://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/pkg/singular/doc/chap1.html">singular</a>, 
<a
href="http://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/pkg/sgpviz/doc/chap1.html">graphviz</a>
</p>
<p>The package <span class="pkg">linboxing</span> currently doesn't work
with this installation.
</p>
<p>
The package <span class="pkg">PolymakeInterface</span> is currently only
unpacked but not installed.
</p>
<p>Note that the <span class="pkg">AtlasRep</span> package contains
directories <code>gap4r4/pkg/atlasrep/data*</code> which are world writable
(for caching downloaded representations). These are emptied with any update
of this distribution.</p>
<p>If you don't want this you can customize the script
<code>gap4r4/local/bin/gapsync</code> in your installation, add the options 
<code>--exclude=pkg/atlasrep/datagens --exclude=pkg/atlasrep/dataword</code>
to the <code>rsync</code> call (search the line containing
<code>--port</code>).
</p>

<p>
The <span class="pkg">Carat</span> package also needs further installation.
(The external binaries hard code their installation path, so I cannot
prepare them for you.) You need a C-compiler (probably <code>gcc</code>) and 
<code>tar</code>. After update go in the subdirectory <code>./gapsync</code>
from the root of your <span class="pkg">GAP</span> installation and call
there the script <code>./FinishInstallCarat</code>. This will install <span
class="pkg">Carat</span> on i686 systems and install it for the
<code>gap64</code> version on x86_64 systems. The script produces the
necessary binaries and unpacks about 150 MB of data files. Finally, call
<code>gapsync</code> to update your workspace.
</p>

<p><span class="pkg">XGap</span>: There were reports that it doesn't work
properly on Linux systems using the <code>/dev</code> file system, due to 
file permission problems. A proper fix is not yet available. 
</p>

<p>You can customize  details of the installation of
<strong>any  package</strong> by copying that package to the directory
<code>gap4r4/local/pkg</code>. You can also install <strong>additional 
packages</strong> there.</p>

<h2><a name="32versus64">Shall I use the 32-bit or 64-bit version of <span
class="pkg">GAP</span>?</a></h2>

<p>
If you have an x86_64 based system you can use both. The 64-bit version uses
for many <span class="pkg">GAP</span> objects twice the memory as the 32-bit
version and this can also make it a bit slower. The 32-bit version of <span
class="pkg">GAP</span> can, depending on the configuration of the Linux
kernel, use at most 2 or 3 Gigabyte of memory (and almost 4 GB on x86_64
systems). So, there are two sitations where you want to use the 64-bit version:
</p>
<ul>
<li>You are mainly using objects in your computations which do take
advantage of the 64-bit architecture, these are compressed vectors and
matrices over small finite fields, very long integers and bit lists.
These objects need essentially the same memory on 32-bit and 64-bit systems
and their basic arithmetic is faster because it works on 64-bit words.
</li>
<li>You really need a lot of memory and have a machine with more than 4 GB
of physical memory. (But recall that many objects use up twice the memory,
in some cases the 64-bit version is only  advantageous if you have even 
more than  8 GB of physical memory!)
</li>
</ul>
