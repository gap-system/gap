           Some reminders for the authors
- Look into hyphenation of URL texts in all output versions.

- Sometimes definition lines can become longer than 80 characters, e.g.,
    ?ConstructWreathSymmetric
  Try to deal with this case better in all output formats.
  Similarly for very long section headers. 
  - extra type of paragraph for reformatting in text version?
  - is there a trick for LaTeX version similar to "end of proof"?
  - HTML version seems to behave reasonably, maybe use &nbsp; in "( function )"

- allow the distribution of different output documents (html, text, pdf,...)
  into different directories (needs to change the handler for GAPDoc books).

- think about combining index entries, when they point to the same section
  (e.g., a function with several types of arguments, where the entries are
  only distinguished by the 'Label' attribute and are explained in the same
  man section).

- investigate using xelatex and direct unicode input for the LaTeX version.
