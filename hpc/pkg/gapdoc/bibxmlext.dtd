<!-- ..................................................................... -->
<!-- Fields from the standard bibliography styles -->

<!--
  - Below is a description of all fields recognized by the standard
  - bibliography styles.  An entry can also contain other fields, which
  - are ignored by those styles.
  - 
  - [address] Usually the address of the publisher or other type of
  - institution  For major publishing houses, van~Leunen recommends
  - omitting the information entirely.  For small publishers, on the other
  - hand, you can help the reader by giving the complete address.
  - 
  - [annote] An annotation  It is not used by the standard bibliography
  - styles, but may be used by others that produce an annotated
  - bibliography.
  - 
  - [author] The name(s) of the author(s), here *not* in the format 
  - described in the LaTeX book. Contains elements <name> which in turn
  - contains elements <first>, <last> for the first name (or first names,
  - fully written or as initials, and including middle initials) and
  - the last name.
  - 
  - [booktitle] Title of a book, part of which is being cited.  See the
  - LaTeX book for how to type titles.  For book entries, use the title
  - field instead.
  - 
  - [chapter] A chapter (or section or whatever) number.
  - 
  - [crossref] The database key of the entry being cross referenced.
  - 
  - [edition] The edition of a book-for example, ``Second''.  This
  - should be an ordinal, and should have the first letter capitalized, as
  - shown here; the standard styles convert to lower case when necessary.
  - 
  - [editor] Name(s) of editor(s), typed as indicated in the LaTeX book.
  - If there is also an author field, then the editor field gives the
  - editor of the book or collection in which the reference appears.
  - 
  - [howpublished] How something strange has been published.  The first
  - word should be capitalized.
  - 
  - [institution] The sponsoring institution of a technical report.
  - 
  - [journal] A journal name.  Abbreviations are provided for many
  - journals; see the Local Guide.
  - 
  - [key] Used for alphabetizing, cross referencing, and creating a label
  - when the ``author'' information (described in Section [ref: ] is
  - missing. This field should not be confused with the key that appears
  - in the \cite command and at the beginning of the database entry.
  - 
  - [month] The month in which the work was published or, for an
  - unpublished work, in which it was written. You should use the
  - standard three-letter abbreviation, as described in Appendix B.1.3 of
  - the LaTeX book.
  - 
  - [note] Any additional information that can help the reader.  The first
  - word should be capitalized.
  - 
  - [number] The number of a journal, magazine, technical report, or of a
  - work in a series.  An issue of a journal or magazine is usually
  - identified by its volume and number; the organization that issues a
  - technical report usually gives it a number; and sometimes books are
  - given numbers in a named series.
  - 
  - [organization] The organization that sponsors a conference or that
  - publishes a manual.
  - 
  - [pages] One or more page numbers or range of numbers, such as 42-111
  - or 7,41,73-97 or 43+ (the `+' in this last example indicates pages
  - following that don't form a simple range).  To make it easier to
  - maintain Scribe-compatible databases, the standard styles convert a
  - single dash (as in 7-33) to the double dash used in TeX to denote
  - number ranges (as in 7-33). Here, we suggest to use the entity
  - &ndash; for a dash in page ranges.
  - 
  - [publisher] The publisher's name.
  - 
  - [school] The name of the school where a thesis was written.
  - 
  - [series] The name of a series or set of books.  When citing an entire
  - book, the the title field gives its title and an optional series field
  - gives the name of a series or multi-volume set in which the book is
  - published.
  - 
  - [title] The work's title. For mathematical formulae use the <M> or
  - <Math> elements explained below (and LaTeX code in the content, without
  - surrounding '$').
  - 
  - [type] The type of a technical report-for example, ``Research
  - Note''.
  - 
  - [volume] The volume of a journal or multivolume book.
  - 
  - [year] The year of publication or, for an unpublished work, the year
  - it was written.  Generally it should consist of four numerals, such as
  - 1984, although the standard styles can handle any year whose last four
  - nonpunctuation characters are numerals, such as `(about 1984)'.

<!-- Here is the main extension compared to the original BibXML definition
     from which is DTD is derived: We want to allow more markup in some 
     elements such that we can use the bibliography for high quality 
     output in other formats than LaTeX. 
     
     - <M> and <Math>, mathematical formulae: Specify LaTeX code for "simple" 
       formulae as content of <M> elements; "simple" means that they can be
       translated to a fairly readable ASCII representation as explained in
       the GAPDoc documentation on "<M>". 
       More complicated formulae are given as content of <Math> elements.
       (Think about an <Alt> alternative for text or HTML representations.)
     
     - <URL>: use these elements to specify URLs, they can be properly
       converted to links if possible in an output format (in that case 
       the Text attribute is used for the visible text).

     - <value key="..."/>:  substituted by the value-attribute specified
       in a <string key="..." value="..."/> element. Can be used anywhere,
       not only for complete fields as in BibTeX.

     - <C> protect case changes: should be used instead of {}'s which are
       used in BibTeX title fields to protect the case of letters from
       changes. 

     - <Alt Only="...">, <Alt Not="...">, alternatives for different 
       output formats:  Use this to specify alternatives, the GAPDoc
       utilities will do some special handling for "Text", "HTML",
       and "BibTeX" as output type.

     - <Wrap Name="...">, generic wrapper for other markup:
       Use this for any other type of markup you are interested in. The
       GAPDoc utilities will ignore the markup, but provide a hook
       to do install handler functions for them.

  - [mrreviewer]  The Mathematical Reviews reviewer. 
  - [price]  The price of the document. 
  - [size]  The physical dimensions of a work. 
  - [URL] The WWW Universal Resource Locator that points to the item being
  -       referenced. This often is used for technical reports to point to the
