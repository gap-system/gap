README for the 4.0/pkg CVS directory
====================================

In this directory you find the current versions of those
packages, potential packages, or other things that use the
package loading mechanism, whose authors have chosen to make use of
our CVS repository to assist their development.

Note in particular that:

1. There are refereed and accepted packages that are not here
2. Files from this directory never get automatically included with any 
releases of GAP
3. There are packages here which have not been (and may never be)
submitted as formal packages
