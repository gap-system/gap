         A list of simple algebras.

   <Description>
         The input <A>FG</A> should be a group algebra of a finite group <M>G</M> 
         over the field <M>F</M>, where <M>F</M> is either an abelian number field 
         (i.e. a subfield of a finite cyclotomic extension of the rationals) or 
         a finite field of characteristic coprime with the order of <M>G</M>.
         <P/> 
         
         The function returns the list of all <E>Wedderburn components</E>
         (<Ref Sect="WedDec" />) of the group algebra <A>FG</A>. 
         If <M>F</M> is an abelian number field then each Wedderburn component is 
         given as a matrix algebra
         of a <E>cyclotomic algebra</E> (<Ref Sect="Cyclotomic" />). 
         If <M>F</M> is a finite field then the Wedderburn components are 
         given as matrix algebras over finite fields.

The previous examples show that if <M>D_{16}</M> denotes the dihedral

(<Ref Sect="WedDec"/>) of <M>\mathbb F_5 D_{16}</M>, <M>&QQ; D_{16}</M> and

In some cases, in characteristic zero, some entries of the output of 
<Ref Attr="WedderburnDecomposition" /> do not provide
full matrix algebras over a <E>cyclotomic algebra</E> 
(<Ref Sect="Cyclotomic" />), but "fractional matrix algebras". 
That entry is not an algebra that can be used as a &GAP; object.
Instead it is a pair formed by a rational giving the "size" of the matrices
and a crossed product.
See <Ref Sect="WedDec" /> for a theoretical explanation of 
this phenomenon. In this case a warning message is displayed.

</Example>

In the previous example we computed the Wedderburn decomposition of the 
rational group algebra <M>&QQ; Q_{16}</M> of the quaternion group of order <M>16</M> 
and the rational group algebra <M>&QQ; S_{4}</M> of the symmetric group on four letters.
For the two group algebras we used both <Ref Attr="WedderburnDecomposition" /> and 
<Ref Attr="WedderburnDecompositionInfo" />. <P/>

The output of <Ref Attr="WedderburnDecomposition" /> shows that 
  <Display>
  &QQ; Q_{16} = 4 &QQ; \oplus M_2( &QQ; ) \oplus A,
  </Display>
  <Display>
  &QQ; S_{4} = 2 &QQ; \oplus 2 M_3( &QQ; ) \oplus B,
  </Display>
where <M>A</M> and <M>B</M> are <E>crossed products</E> (<Ref Sect="CrossedProd" />)
with coefficients in the 
cyclotomic fields <M>&QQ; (\xi_8)</M> and <M>&QQ; (\xi_3)</M> respectively. 
This output can be used as a &GAP; object, but it does not give clear 
information on the structure of the algebras <M>A</M> and <M>B</M>. <P/>

The numerical information displayed by 
<Ref Attr="WedderburnDecompositionInfo" /> means that 
  <Display>
  A = &QQ; (\xi|\xi^8=1)[g | \xi^g = \xi^7 = \xi^{-1}, g^2 = \xi^4 = -1],
  </Display>
  <Display>
  B = &QQ; (\xi|\xi^3=1)[g | \xi^g = \xi^2 = \xi^{-1}, g^2 = 1].
  </Display>
Both <M>A</M> and <M>B</M> are quaternion algebras over its centre which is
<M>&QQ; (\xi+\xi^{-1})</M> and the former is equal to <M>&QQ; (\sqrt{2})</M> and 
<M>&QQ;</M> respectively. <P/>  

In <M>B</M>, one has <M>(g+1)(g-1)=0</M>, while <M>g</M> is neither <M>1</M> nor 
<M>-1</M>. This shows that <M>B=M_2( &QQ; )</M>. 
However the relation <M>g^2=-1</M> in <M>A</M> shows that 
  <Display>
  A=&QQ; (\sqrt{2})[i,g|i^2=g^2=-1,ig=-gi]
  </Display>
and so <M>A</M> is a division algebra with centre <M>&QQ; (\sqrt{2})</M>, which is a 
subalgebra of the algebra of Hamiltonian quaternions. 
This could be deduced also using well known methods on cyclic algebras (see
e.g. <Cite Key="R" />).
<P/>

The next example shows the output of <C>WedderburnDecompositionInfo</C> 
for <M>&QQ; G</M> and <M>&QQ; (\xi_3) G</M>, where <M>G=SmallGroup(48,15)</M>. 
The user can compare it with the 
output of <Ref Attr="WedderburnDecomposition" /> for the same group in the 
previous section. Notice that the last entry of the 
<E>Wedderburn decomposition</E> (<Ref Sect="WedDec" />)
of <M>&QQ; G</M> is not given as a matrix algebra of a cyclic algebra. 
However, the corresponding entry of <M>&QQ; (\xi_3) G</M> is a matrix algebra of a cyclic algebra.

In some cases some of the first entries of the output of 
<Ref Attr="WedderburnDecompositionInfo" /> are not integers and so the correspoding

   <Description>
        In the three-argument version the input must be formed by a 
        <E>semisimple rational group algebra</E> <A>QG</A>
        (see <Ref Sect="Semisimple" />) and two subgroups <A>K</A>

        pair</E> (<Ref Sect="SSPDef" />) of <M>G</M>. <P/>
        
        The three-argument version

        of the rational group algebra <A>QG</A>

        In the four-argument version the first argument is a semisimple 
        finite group algebra <A>FG</A>, <A>(K,H)</A> is a strong Shoda 
        pair of <M>G</M> and the fourth input data is either 
        a generating <M>q</M>-cyclotomic class
