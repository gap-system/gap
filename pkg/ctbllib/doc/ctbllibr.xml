<Index>library of character tables</Index>

This section gives a brief overview of the contents of the &GAP;
character table library.
For the details about, e.&nbsp;g., the structure of data files,
see Section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="sec:technicalities"/>.

<P/>

The changes in the character table library since the first release of
&GAP;&nbsp;4 are listed in a file that can be fetched from

<P/>

<URL>http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~Thomas.Breuer/ctbllib/htm/ctbldiff.html
</URL>.

<P/>

There are three different kinds of character tables in the &GAP; library,
namely <E>ordinary character tables</E>, <E>Brauer tables</E>,
and <E>generic character tables</E>.
Note that the Brauer table and the corresponding ordinary table of a group
determine the <E>decomposition matrix</E> of the group
(and the decomposition matrices of its blocks).
These decomposition matrices can be computed from the ordinary and modular
irreducibles with &GAP;,
see Section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="Operations Concerning Blocks" BookName="ref"/>
for details.
A collection of <C>PDF</C> files of the known decomposition matrices
of almost simple groups in the &GAP; Character Table Library can also be
found at

<Subsection Label="subsec:contents-ordinary">
<Heading>Ordinary Character Tables</Heading>

Two different aspects are useful to list the ordinary character tables
available in &GAP;, namely the aspect of the <E>source</E> of the tables
and that of <E>connections</E> between the tables.

<P/>

As for the source, there are first of all two big sources,
namely the &ATLAS; of Finite Groups
(see Section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="sec:ATLAS Tables"/>)
and the &CAS; library of character tables (see&nbsp;<Cite Key="NPP84"/>).
Many &ATLAS; tables are contained in the &CAS; library,
and difficulties may arise because the succession of characters and classes
in &CAS; tables and &ATLAS; tables are in general different,
so see Section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="sec:CAS Tables"/> for the relations between
these two variants of character tables of the same group.
A large subset of the &CAS; tables is the set of tables of
Sylow normalizers of sporadic simple groups
as published in&nbsp;<Cite Key="Ost86"/>
&nbsp;this may be viewed as another source of character tables.
The library also contains the character tables of factor groups of space
groups (computed by W.&nbsp;Hanrath, see&nbsp;<Cite Key="Han88"/>)
that are part of&nbsp;<Cite Key="HP89"/>, in the form of two microfiches;
these tables are given in &CAS; format
(see Section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="sec:CAS Tables"/>) on the microfiches,
but they had not been part of the <Q>official</Q> &CAS; library.

<P/>

To avoid confusion about the ordering of classes and characters in a given
table, authorship and so on,
the <Ref Attr="InfoText" BookName="ref"/> value of the table
contains the information
<List>
<Mark><C>origin:&nbsp;ATLAS of finite groups</C></Mark>
<Item>
  for &ATLAS; tables (see Section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="sec:ATLAS Tables"/>),
</Item>
<Mark><C>origin:&nbsp;Ostermann</C></Mark>
<Item>
  for tables contained in&nbsp;<Cite Key="Ost86"/>,
</Item>
<Mark><C>origin:&nbsp;CAS library</C></Mark>
<Item>
  for any table of the &CAS; table library that is contained
  neither in the &ATLAS; nor in&nbsp;<Cite Key="Ost86"/>,
  and
</Item>
<Mark><C>origin:&nbsp;Hanrath library</C></Mark>
<Item>
  for tables contained in the microfiches in&nbsp;<Cite Key="HP89"/>.
</Item>
</List>

The <Ref Attr="InfoText" BookName="ref"/> value usually contains
more detailed information,
for example that the table in question is the character table of a maximal
subgroup of an almost simple group.
If the table was contained in the &CAS; library
then additional information may be available via the <Ref Func="CASInfo"/>
value.

<P/>

If one is interested in the aspect of connections between the tables,
i.&nbsp;e., the internal structure of the library of ordinary tables,
the contents can be listed up the following way.

<P/>

We have

<List>
<Item>
  all &ATLAS; tables (see Section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="sec:ATLAS Tables"/>),
  i.&nbsp;e., the tables of the simple groups which are contained in the
  &ATLAS; of Finite Groups,
  and the tables of cyclic and bicyclic extensions of these groups,
</Item>
<Item>
  most tables of maximal subgroups of sporadic simple groups
  (<E>not all</E> for <M>B</M> and <M>M</M>),
</Item>
<Item>
  some tables of maximal subgroups of other &ATLAS; tables,
  where the list of maximal subgroups is complete if the <Ref Func="Maxes"/>
  value for the table is known,
</Item>
<Item>
  the tables of most Sylow normalizers of sporadic simple groups,
  as printed in&nbsp;<Cite Key="Ost86"/>
  (<E>not</E> <M>J_4N2</M>, <M>Co_1N2</M>, <M>Fi_{22}N2</M>,
  and several for <M>HN</M>, <M>Fi_{23}</M>, <M>Fi_{24}^\prime</M>,
  <M>B</M>, <M>M</M>)
</Item>
<Item>
  some tables of element centralizers
</Item>
<Item>
  some tables of Sylow subgroups
</Item>
<Item>
  a few other tables, e.&nbsp;g.&nbsp;<C>W(F4)</C>
<!-- %T namely which? -->
</Item>
</List>

<P/>

<E>Note</E> that class fusions stored on library tables are not guaranteed
to be compatible for any two subgroups of a group and their intersection,
and they are not guaranteed to be consistent
w.&nbsp;r.&nbsp;t.&nbsp;the composition of maps.

<Subsection Label="subsec:contents-modular">
<Heading>Brauer Tables</Heading>

The library contains all tables of the &ATLAS; of
Brauer Tables (<Cite Key="JLPW95"/>),
and many other Brauer tables of bicyclic extensions of simple groups
which are known yet.

The Brauer tables in the library contain the information
<Verb>
origin: modular ATLAS of finite groups

in their <Ref Attr="InfoText" BookName="ref"/> string.

Generic character tables provide a means for writing down the character
tables of all groups in a (usually infinite) series of similar groups,
e.&nbsp;g., cyclic groups, or symmetric groups, or the general linear groups
GL<M>(2,q)</M> where <M>q</M> ranges over certain prime powers.

<P/>

Let <M>\{ G_q | q \in I \}</M> be such a series,
where <M>I</M> is an index set.
The character table of one fixed member <M>G_q</M> could be computed using a
function that takes <M>q</M> as only argument
and constructs the table of <M>G_q</M>.
It is, however, often desirable to compute not only the whole table but to
access just one specific character, or to compute just one character value,
without computing the whole character table.

<P/>

For example, both the conjugacy classes and the irreducible characters of
the symmetric group <M>S_n</M> are in bijection with the partitions of
<M>n</M>.
Thus for given <M>n</M> it makes sense to ask for the character corresponding
to a particular partition,
or just for its character value at another partition.

<P/>

A generic character table in &GAP; allows one such local evaluations.
In this sense, &GAP; can deal also with character tables that are too big
to be computed and stored as a whole.

<P/>

Currently the only operations for generic tables supported by &GAP; are
the specialisation of the parameter <M>q</M> in order to compute the whole
character table of <M>G_q</M>, and local evaluation
(see&nbsp;<Ref Func="ClassParameters" BookName="ref"/> for an example).
&GAP; does <E>not</E> support the computation of, e.&nbsp;g.,
generic scalar products.

<P/>

While the numbers of conjugacy classes for the members of a series of groups
are usually not bounded,
there is always a fixed finite number of <E>types</E> (equivalence classes)
of conjugacy classes;
very often the equivalence relation is isomorphism of the centralizers of the
representatives.

<P/>

For each type <M>t</M> of classes and a fixed <M>q \in I</M>,
a <E>parametrisation</E> of the classes in <M>t</M> is a function
that assigns to each conjugacy class of <M>G_q</M> in <M>t</M>
a <E>parameter</E> by which it is uniquely determined.
Thus the classes are indexed by pairs <M>[t,p_t]</M> consisting of
a type <M>t</M> and a parameter <M>p_t</M> for that type.

<P/>

For any generic table, there has to be a fixed number of types of irreducible
characters of <M>G_q</M>, too.
Like the classes, the characters of each type are parametrised.

<P/>

In &GAP;, the parametrisations of classes and characters for tables
computed from generic tables is stored using the attributes
<Ref Attr="ClassParameters" BookName="ref"/> and
<Ref Attr="CharacterParameters" BookName="ref"/>.

<Subsection Label="subsec:generictablesavailable">
<Heading>Available generic character tables</Heading>

Currently, generic tables of the following groups

We list the function calls needed to get a specialized table,
the generic table itself can be accessed by calling
<Ref Func="CharacterTable" BookName="ref"/>
with the first argument only;
for example, <C>CharacterTable( "Cyclic" )</C> yields the generic table of
cyclic groups.

In addition to the above calls that really use generic tables,
the following calls to

<Index>library of character tables</Index>

The &GAP; character table library contains all character tables of bicyclic
extensions of simple groups
that are included in the &ATLAS; of Finite Groups
(<Cite Key="CCN85"/>, from now on called &ATLAS;),
and the Brauer tables contained in the &ATLAS; of Brauer
Characters (<Cite Key="JLPW95"/>).

<P/>

These tables have the information
<Verb>
origin: ATLAS of finite groups
</Verb>
or
<Verb>
origin: modular ATLAS of finite groups
</Verb>
in their <Ref Attr="InfoText" BookName="ref"/> value,
they are simply called &ATLAS; tables further on.

<P/>

For displaying &ATLAS; tables with the row labels used in
the &ATLAS;, or for displaying decomposition matrices,
see&nbsp;<Ref Func="LaTeXStringDecompositionMatrix" BookName="ref"/>
and&nbsp;<Ref Func="AtlasLabelsOfIrreducibles"/>.

<P/>

In addition to the information given in Chapters&nbsp;6 to&nbsp;8 of the
&ATLAS; which tell you how to read the printed tables,
there are some rules relating these to the corresponding &GAP; tables.

<Subsection Label="subsec:Improvements">
<Heading>Improvements to the &ATLAS;</Heading>

For the &GAP; Character Table Library not the printed versions of the
&ATLAS; of Finite Groups and the &ATLAS; of Brauer Characters are relevant
but the revised versions given by the currently three lists of improvements
that are maintained by Simon Norton.
The first such list is contained in&nbsp;<Cite Key="BN95"/>,
and is printed in the Appendix of&nbsp;<Cite Key="JLPW95"/>;
it contains the improvements that had been known until the
<Q>&ATLAS; of Brauer Characters</Q> was published.
The second list contains the improvements to the &ATLAS; of Finite Groups
that were found since the publication of&nbsp;<Cite Key="JLPW95"/>.
It can be found in the internet, an HTML version at

<P/>

<URL>http://web.mat.bham.ac.uk/atlas/html/atlasmods.html</URL>

<P/>

and a DVI version at

<P/>

<URL>http://web.mat.bham.ac.uk/atlas/html/atlasmods.dvi</URL>.

<!-- find better addresses, and update the lists -->

<P/>

The third list contains the improvements to the &ATLAS; of Brauer Characters,
HTML and PDF versions can be found in the internet at

<P/>

<URL>http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~MOC/ABCerr.html</URL>

<P/>

and

<P/>

<URL>http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~MOC/ABCerr.pdf</URL>,

<P/>

respectively.

<P/>

Also some tables are regarded as &ATLAS; tables that are
not printed in the &ATLAS; but available in &ATLAS; format,
according to the lists of improvements mentioned above.
Currently these are the tables related to <M>L_2(49)</M>, <M>L_2(81)</M>,
<M>L_6(2)</M>, <M>O_8^-(3)</M>, <M>O_8^+(3)</M>, <M>S_{10}(2)</M>,
and <M>{}^2E_6(2).3</M>.

For the tables of <M>3.McL</M>, <M>3_2.U_4(3)</M> and its covers,
and <M>3_2.U_4(3).2_3</M> and its covers,
the power maps are not uniquely determined by the information
from the &ATLAS; but determined only up to matrix automorphisms
(see&nbsp;<Ref Func="MatrixAutomorphisms" BookName="ref"/>)
of the irreducible characters.
In these cases, the first possible map according to lexicographical
ordering was chosen, and the automorphisms are listed in the
<Ref Attr="InfoText" BookName="ref"/> strings of the tables.

attribute <Ref Func="ProjectivesInfo"/> of the &GAP; table object of <M>G</M>
(or <M>G.a</M>) is set;
the <C>chars</C> component of the record in question
is the list of values lists of those faithful projective irreducibles
that are printed in the &ATLAS; (so-called <E>proxy character</E>),
and the <C>map</C> component lists the positions of columns in the covering
for which the column is printed in the &ATLAS;

<Subsection Label="subsec:Tables of Isoclinic Groups">
<Heading>Tables of Isoclinic Groups</Heading>

As described in Chapter&nbsp;6, Section&nbsp;7 and
in Chapter&nbsp;7, Section&nbsp;18 of the &ATLAS;,
there exist two (often nonisomorphic) groups of structure
<M>2.G.2</M> for a simple group <M>G</M>, which are isoclinic.
The table in the &GAP; Character Table Library is the one printed in the
&ATLAS;,
the table of the other isoclinic variant can be constructed using
<Ref Func="CharacterTableIsoclinic" BookName="ref"/>.

<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->
<Subsection Label="subsec:Ordering of Characters and Classes">
<Heading>Ordering of Characters and Classes</Heading>

(Throughout this section, <M>G</M> always means the simple group involved.)
<Enum>
<Item>
  For <M>G</M> itself, the ordering of classes and characters in the &GAP;
  table coincides with the one in the &ATLAS;.
</Item>
<Item>
  For an automorphic extension <M>G.a</M>,
  there are three types of characters.
  <List>
  <Item>
    If a character <M>\chi</M> of <M>G</M> extends to <M>G.a</M> then the
    different extensions <M>\chi^0, \chi^1, \ldots, \chi^{{a-1}}</M>
    are consecutive in the table of <M>G.a</M>
    (see <Cite Key="CCN85" Where="Chapter&nbsp;7, Section&nbsp;16"/>).
  </Item>
  <Item>
    If some characters of <M>G</M> fuse to give a single character of
    <M>G.a</M> then the position of that character in the table of <M>G.a</M>
    is given by the position of the first involved character of <M>G</M>.
  </Item>
  <Item>
    If both extension and fusion occur for a character
    then the resulting characters are consecutive in the table of <M>G.a</M>,
    and each replaces the first involved character of <M>G</M>.
  </Item>
  </List>
</Item>
<Item>
  Similarly, there are different types of classes for an automorphic
  extension <M>G.a</M>, as follows.
  <List>
  <Item>
    If some classes collapse then the resulting class replaces the first
    involved class of <M>G</M>.
  </Item>
  <Item>
    For <M>a &gt; 2</M>,
    any proxy class and its algebraic conjugates that are not
    printed in the &ATLAS; are consecutive in the table of <M>G.a</M>;
    if more than two classes of <M>G.a</M> have the same proxy class
    (the only case that actually occurs is for <M>a = 5</M>)
    then the ordering of non-printed classes is the natural one of
    corresponding Galois conjugacy operators <M>*k</M>
    (see <Cite Key="CCN85" Where="Chapter&nbsp;7, Section&nbsp;19"/>).
  </Item>
  <Item>
    For <M>a_1</M>, <M>a_2</M> dividing <M>a</M> such that <M>a_1 \leq a_2</M>,
    the classes of <M>G.a_1</M> in <M>G.a</M> precede the classes of
    <M>G.a_2</M> not contained in <M>G.a_1</M>.
    This ordering is the same as in the &ATLAS;,
    with the only exception <M>U_3(8).6</M>.
  </Item>
  </List>
</Item>
<Item>
  For a central extension <M>M.G</M>, there are two different types of
  characters, as follows.
  <List>
  <Item>
    Each character can be regarded as a faithful character of a factor group
    <M>m.G</M>, where <M>m</M> divides <M>M</M>.
    Characters with the same kernel are consecutive as in the
    &ATLAS;,
    the ordering of characters with different kernels is given by the order
    of precedence <M>1, 2, 4, 3, 6, 12</M> for the different values of <M>m</M>.
  </Item>
  <Item>
    If <M>m &gt; 2</M>,
    a faithful character of <M>m.G</M> that is printed in the &ATLAS;
    (a so-called <E>proxy character</E>) represents two or more Galois
    conjugates.
    In each &ATLAS; table in &GAP;,
    a proxy character always precedes the non-printed characters with this
    proxy.
    The case <M>m = 12</M> is the only one that actually occurs
    where more than one character for a proxy is not printed.
    In this case, the non-printed characters are ordered according to the
    corresponding Galois conjugacy operators <M>*5</M>, <M>*7</M>,
    <M>*11</M>
    (in this order).
  </Item>
  </List>
</Item>
<Item>
  For the classes of a central extension we have the following.
  <List>
  <Item>
    The preimages of a <M>G</M>-class in <M>M.G</M> are subsequent,
    the ordering is the same as that of the lifting order rows in
    <Cite Key="CCN85" Where="Chapter&nbsp;7, Section&nbsp;7"/>.
  </Item>
  <Item>
    The primitive roots of unity chosen to represent the generating
    central element (i.&nbsp;e., the element in the second class of the &GAP;
    table) are  <C>E(3)</C>, <C>E(4)</C>,
    <C>E(6)^5</C> (<C>= E(2)*E(3)</C>),
    and <C>E(12)^7</C> (<C>= E(3)*E(4)</C>),
    for <M>m = 3</M>, <M>4</M>, <M>6</M>, and <M>12</M>, respectively.
  </Item>
  </List>
</Item>
<Item>
  For tables of bicyclic extensions <M>m.G.a</M>, both the rules for
  automorphic and central extensions hold.
  Additionally we have the following three rules.
  <List>
  <Item>
    Whenever classes of the subgroup <M>m.G</M> collapse in <M>m.G.a</M>
    then the resulting class replaces the first involved class.
  </Item>
  <Item>
    Whenever characters of the subgroup <M>m.G</M> collapse fuse in <M>m.G.a</M>
    then the result character replaces the first involved character.
  </Item>
  <Item>
    Extensions of a character are subsequent, and the extensions of a
    proxy character precede the extensions of characters with this proxy
    that are not printed.
  </Item>
  <Item>
    Preimages of a class of <M>G.a</M> in <M>m.G.a</M> are subsequent,
    and the preimages of a proxy class precede the preimages of non-printed
    classes with this proxy.
  </Item>
  </List>
</Item>
</Enum>

<Heading>Examples of the &ATLAS; Format for &GAP; Tables</Heading>

<Index>character tables!CAS</Index>
<Index>tables!library</Index>
<Index>library of character tables</Index>

We give three little examples for the conventions stated in
Section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="sec:ATLAS Tables"/>,
listing both the &ATLAS; format and the table displayed by &GAP;.

<P/>

First, let <M>G</M> be the trivial group.
We consider the cyclic group <M>C_6</M> of order <M>6</M>.
It can be viewed in several ways, namely
<List>
<Item>
  as a downward extension of the factor group <M>C_2</M> which contains
  <M>G</M> as a subgroup,
  or equivalently,
  as an upward extension of the subgroup <M>C_3</M> which has a factor group
  isomorphic to <M>G</M>:

<P/>

The tables of <M>G</M>, <M>2.G</M>, <M>3.G</M>, <M>6.G</M> and <M>G.2</M>
are known from the first
example, that of <M>2.G.2</M> will be given in the next one.
So here we print only the &GAP; tables of <M>3.G.2 \cong D_6</M> and
<M>6.G.2 \cong D_{12}</M>.

<P/>

In <M>3.G.2</M>, the characters <C>X.1</C>, <C>X.2</C> extend <M>\chi_1</M>;
<M>\chi_3</M> and its non-printed partner fuse to give <C>X.3</C>,
and the two preimages of <C>1A</C> of order <M>3</M> collapse.

<P/>

In  <M>6.G.2</M>,  <C>Y.1</C> to <C>Y.4</C> are extensions of <M>\chi_1</M>,
<M>\chi_2</M>,
so these characters are the inflated characters from <M>2.G.2</M>
(with respect to the factor fusion <C>[ 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4 ]</C>).
<C>Y.5</C> is inflated from <M>3.G.2</M>
(with respect to the factor fusion <C>[ 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 3 ]</C>),
and <C>Y.6</C> is the result of the fusion of <M>\chi_4</M> and its
non-printed partner.

<P/>

For the last example, let <M>G</M> be the elementary abelian group <M>2^2</M>
of order <M>4</M>.
Consider the following tables.

<P/>

In the table of <M>G.3 \cong A_4</M>, the characters <M>\chi_2</M>,
<M>\chi_3</M>, and <M>\chi_4</M> fuse,
and the classes <C>2A</C>, <C>2B</C>  and <C>2C</C> collapse.
For getting the table of <M>2.G \cong Q_8</M>,
one just has to split the class <C>2A</C> and adjust the representative
orders.
Finally, the table of <M>2.G.3 \cong SL_2(3)</M> is given;
the class fusion corresponding to the injection
<M>2.G \hookrightarrow 2.G.3</M>
is <C>[ 1, 2, 3, 3, 3 ]</C>, and the factor fusion corresponding to the
epimorphism <M>2.G.3 \rightarrow G.3</M> is <C>[ 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4 ]</C>.

One of the predecessors of &GAP; was
&CAS; (<E>C</E>haracter <E>A</E>lgorithm <E>S</E>ystem,
see&nbsp;<Cite Key="NPP84"/>),
which had also a library of character tables.
All these character tables are available in &GAP;
except if stated otherwise in the file <F>doc/ctbldiff.pdf</F>.
This sublibrary has been completely revised before it was included in &GAP;,
for example, errors have been corrected and power maps have been completed.

<P/>

Any &CAS; table is accessible by each of its &CAS; names
(except if stated otherwise in <F>doc/ctbldiff.pdf</F>), that is,
the table name or the filename used in &CAS;.

To install the package unpack the archive file in a
directory in the <F>pkg</F> directory of your local copy of &GAP;&nbsp;4.
This might be the <F>pkg</F> directory of the &GAP;&nbsp;4 home directory,
see Section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="Installing a GAP Package" BookName="ref"/>
for details.
It is however also possible to keep an additional <F>pkg</F> directory
in your private directories,
see&nbsp;<Ref Sect="GAP Root Directory" BookName="ref"/>.
The latter possibility <E>must</E> be chosen if you do not have write access
to the &GAP; root directory.

The package consists entirely of &GAP; code,
no external binaries need to be compiled.

&GAP; users may want to extend the character table library in different
respects.

<P/>

<List>
<Item>
  Probably the easiest change is to <E>add new admissible names</E>
  to library tables, in order to use these names in calls of
  <Ref Meth="CharacterTable" Label="for a string"/>.
  This can be done using <Ref Func="NotifyNameOfCharacterTable"/>.
</Item>
<Item>
  The next kind of changes is the <E>addition of new fusions</E>
  between library tables.
  Once a fusion map is known, it can be added to the library file containing
  the table of the subgroup, using the format produced by
  <Ref Func="LibraryFusion"/>.
</Item>
<Item>
  The last kind of changes is the <E>addition of new character tables</E>
  to the &GAP; character table library.
  Data files containing tables in library format
  (i.&nbsp;e., in the form of calls to <C>MOT</C> or <C>MBT</C>)
  can be produced using <Ref Func="PrintToLib"/>.
  <P/>
  If you have an ordinary character table in library format which you want to
  add to the table library, for example because it shall be accessible via
  <Ref Meth="CharacterTable" Label="for a string"/>,
  you must notify this table, i.&nbsp;e., tell &GAP; in which file it can be
  found,
  and which names shall be admissible for it.
  This can be done using <Ref Func="NotifyCharacterTable"/>.
