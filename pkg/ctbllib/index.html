<!-- =================================================================== -->
<h3 class="pcenter"><span class="Heading">Description</span></h3>

<p>
This is Version 1.1 of
the <span class="pkg">GAP</span> Character Table Library,
which is an add-on package for both <span class="pkg">GAP</span> 3.4
and <span class="pkg">GAP</span> 4.
Up to <span class="pkg">GAP</span> 4.2, the library of character tables
had been distributed as an inseparable part of the
<span class="pkg">GAP</span> distribution.
The aims of the restructuring are the following.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
  Upgrades of the <span class="pkg">GAP</span> Character Table Library
  are possible, independent of <span class="pkg">GAP</span> releases,
  via the mechanism that has been used already for installing or upgrading
  <span class="pkg">GAP</span> packages;
  each such upgrade will get a version number.
</li>
<li>
  The new directory structure provides an environment that is more suitable
  for the further development of the
  <span class="pkg">GAP</span> library of character tables.
</li>
<li>
  It is easy to omit the character table library from
  the <span class="pkg">GAP</span> 4 installation
  if one is not interested in it.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
There is a manual (available here in <a href="htm/chapters.htm">HTML</a>
and <a href="doc/manual.pdf">PDF</a> format)
that describes the available functions in detail.
</p>

<p>
The manual of the <span class="pkg">GAP</span> Character Table Library
is intended for <span class="pkg">GAP</span> 4.4,
in particular the cross-references refer to
the <span class="pkg">GAP</span> 4.4 Reference Manual.
So when using the new character table library with
<span class="pkg">GAP</span> 3.4,
one should still consult the documentation of the character table library
contained in the Reference Manual of <span class="pkg">GAP</span> 3.4.

<p>
The data contained in the <span class="pkg">GAP</span> Character Table Library
have been contributed by various people.
Important sources of the ordinary character tables are
</p>

<ul>
<li>
  the famous Atlas of Finite Groups
  (see Chapter 8, paragraph 5 of this book for a list of contributors),
</li>
<li>

    of finite groups,<br/>

Individual contributions are often listed in the ``InfoText创s
of the <span class="pkg">GAP</span> library tables.

For the origin of the Brauer tables in
the <span class="pkg">GAP</span> Character Table Library,
see the 
<a href="http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~MOC/">homepage
of the Atlas of Brauer Characters</a>.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="pkg">GAP</span> interface and the data format used
were developed by

<h3 class="pcenter"><span class="Heading">Known Bugs</span></h3>

<p>
The following bugs have been found in the current version of the
<span class="pkg">GAP</span> Character Table Library.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
   The character table with the name
   <span class="tt">P12/G1/L2/V1/ext2</span> is not correct,
   some of its class multiplication coefficients are not integral.
   (This problem occurs already in the microfiches that are contained
   in the book ``Perfect Groups创.)
</li>
<li>
   The second power map in the character table with the name
   <span class="tt">13^1+2.2A4</span> is not correct.
</li>
<li>
   The character table with the name
   <span class="tt">P41/G1/L1/V4/ext2</span> is not correct,
   this table is not the character table of a finite group.
   (This problem occurs already in the microfiches that are contained
   in the book ``Perfect Groups创.)
</li>
<li>
   The name <span class="tt">2G2(3)</span> is erroneously associated with
   the character table of <span class="tt">L2(8)</span>;
   the correct table would be that of <span class="tt">L2(3).3</span>.
   (This error has been communicated by Felix Noeske.)
</li>
<li>
   The 21th and 22th maximal subgroup of the table with the name
   <span class="tt">Co1</span> must be swapped,
   that is, the names <span class="tt">Co1M21</span> and
   <span class="tt">Co1M22</span> are not correct,
   according to the ordering w.r.t. increasing index.
</li>
<li>
   The 19th and 20th maximal subgroup of the table with the name
   <span class="tt">F3+</span> must be swapped,
   that is, the names <span class="tt">F3+M19</span> and
   <span class="tt">F3+M20</span> are not correct,
   according to the ordering w.r.t. increasing index.
</li>
</ul>
