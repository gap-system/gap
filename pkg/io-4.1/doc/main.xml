<Heading>Preface</Heading>
<Index><Package>IO</Package></Index>

The purpose of this package is to allow efficient and flexible input/output
operations from &GAP;. This is achieved by providing bindings to the
low-level I/O functions in the C-library. On top of this an implementation
of buffered I/O in the &GAP; language is provided. Further, a framework
for serialisation of arbitrary &GAP; objects is implemented.
Finally, an implementation of the client side of the HTTP protocol is
included in the package.<P/>

This package allows to use file based I/O, access to links and file
systems, pipes, sockets, and the UDP and TCP/IP protocols.<P/>

By default the <Package>IO</Package> package  is  not automatically   loaded
by   &GAP;   when   it   is  installed.   You  must   load  the   package
with   <C>LoadPackage("IO");</C>   before  its   functions   become
available.<P/>

Please,            send             me            an            e-mail
(<Email>neunhoef@mcs.st-and.ac.uk</Email>)  if  you  have  any
questions,  remarks, suggestions,  etc. concerning  this package.
Also, I would like to hear about applications of this package.<P/>

<Chapter Label="Chap-Install">
<Heading>Installation of the <Package>IO</Package>-package</Heading>

To get the newest version of this &GAP; 4 package download one of the
archive files
<List>
<Item> <F>io-x.x.tar.gz</F> </Item>
<Item> <F>io-x.x.zoo</F> </Item>
<Item> <F>io-x.x.tar.bz2</F> </Item>
<Item> <F>io-x.x.zip</F> </Item>
</List>
and unpack it using 
<Verb>
    gunzip io-x.x.tar.gz; tar xvf io-x.x.tar
</Verb>
respectively
<Verb>
    unzoo -x io-x.x.zoo
</Verb>
and so on. <P/>

Do this in a directory called <Q><F>pkg</F></Q>, preferably (but not necessarily)
in the <Q><F>pkg</F></Q> subdirectory of your &GAP; 4 installation. It creates a
subdirectory called <Q><F>io</F></Q>.<P/>

The package  will not work without the following compilation step.<P/>

To compile the C part of the package do (in the <F>pkg</F> directory)

<Verb>
    cd io
    ./configure
    make
</Verb>

If you installed the package in another <Q><F>pkg</F></Q> directory than
the standard <Q><F>pkg</F></Q> directory in your &GAP; 4 installation,
then you have to do two things. Firstly during compilation 
you have to use the option
<C>--with-gaproot=PATH</C> of the <F>configure</F> script
where <Q>PATH</Q> is a path to the main &GAP; root directory 
(if not given the
default <Q><F>../..</F></Q> is assumed). <P/>
Secondly you have to 
specify the path to the directory containing your
<Q><F>pkg</F></Q>
directory to &GAP;'s list of directories. This can be done by starting
&GAP; with the <Q><F>-l</F></Q> command line option followed by the name
of the directory and a semicolon. Then your directory is prepended to
the list of directories searched. Otherwise the package is not found by
&GAP;. Of course, you can add this option to your &GAP; startup script.
<P/>

If you installed &GAP; on several architectures, you must execute the
configure/make step for each of the architectures. You can either
do this immediately after
configuring and compiling &GAP; itself on this architecture, or alternatively (when
using version 4.5 of &GAP; or newer) set the environment variable
<C>CONFIGNAME</C> to the name of the configuration you used when
compiling &GAP; before running <C>./configure</C>. 
Note however that your compiler choice and flags
(environment variables <C>CC</C> and <C>CFLAGS</C>) need to be
chosen to match the setup of the original &GAP; compilation. For
example you have to specify 32-bit or 64-bit mode correctly!<P/>


<Section>
<Heading>Static linking</Heading>


This feature does not work in this version of the package.
We leave the old documentation here for the case that the
feature will be reenabled inthe future.<P/>

This might be interesting for M&dollar; Windows users, as
dynamic loading of binary modules does not always work there.
You can also create a new statically linked <Q><F>gap</F></Q> binary as follows:
<P/>

Go into the main &GAP; directory and then into <F>bin/BINDIR</F>. Here
<F>BINDIR</F> means the directory containing the <Q><F>gap</F></Q> 
executable after
compiling <Q><F>gap</F></Q>. This directory also contains the &GAP; compiler script
<Q><F>gac</F></Q>. Assuming IO in the standard location you can then say

<Verb>
    ./gac -o gap-static -p "-DIOSTATIC -I../../pkg/io/bin/BINDIR" \
        -P "-static" ../../pkg/io/src/io.c
</Verb>

Then copy your <Q><F>gap</F></Q> start script to, say, <Q><F>gaps</F></Q> and change the
references to the &GAP; binary to <Q><F>gap-static</F></Q>.<P/>

Note that you have to replace <F>BINDIR</F> by the name containing the 
<Q><F>gap</F></Q>
executable after compiling GAP as above. If you have installed the
package in a different place than the standard, you have to replace
<Q><F>../..</F></Q> in the above command by the path to the directory containing
the <Q><F>pkg</F></Q> directory into which you installed
<Package>IO</Package>.

If you want to install more than one package with a C-part like this
package, you can still create a statically linked &GAP; executable by
combining all the compile and link options and all the .c files as
in the ./gac command above. For the IO package, you have to add
<Verb>
    -DIOSTATIC -I../../pkg/io/bin/BINDIR
</Verb>
to the string of the -p option and the file
<Verb>
  ../../pkg/io/src/io.c
</Verb>
somewhere on the command line. As above, <Q><F>../..</F></Q> and 
<Q><F>BINDIR</F></Q> have to be replaced if you installed in a
non-standard location.

<Section>
<Heading>Recompiling the documentation</Heading>

Recompiling the documentation is possible by the command <Q><F>gap
makedoc.g</F></Q>
in the <F>io</F> directory. But this should not be necessary.

<C>telldir</C>, 
<C>unlink</C>, 
<C>write</C>. <P/>

Use the <C>man</C> command in your shell to get information about these
functions.<P/>

For each of these functions there is a corresponding &GAP; global function 
with the prefix <C>IO&uscore;</C> before its name. Apart from minor differences
(see below) they take exactly the same arguments as their C
counterparts. Strings must be specified as &GAP; strings and integers
as &GAP; immediate integers. Return values are in general the same as
for the C counterparts. However, an error condition is indicated by the
value <C>fail</C> instead of -1, and if the result can only be success
or failure, <C>true</C> indicates success. <P/>

All errors are reported via the <Ref Func="LastSystemError"
BookName="ref"/> function.<P/>

In the C library a lot of integers are defined as macros in header files.
All the necessary values for the above functions are bound to their name
in the global <C>IO</C> record. <P/>

<E>Warning:</E> Existence of many of these functions and constants
is platform dependent. The compilation process checks existence and
this leads to the situation that on the &GAP; levels the functions
and constants are there or not. If you want to develop platform
independent &GAP; code using this package, then you have to check
for existence of the functions and constants you need.

<Section>
<Heading>Differences in arguments - an overview</Heading>

The <C>open</C> function has to be called with three arguments. The
version with two arguments is not available on the &GAP; level. <P/>

The <C>read</C> function takes four arguments: <A>fd</A> is an integer
file descriptor, <A>st</A> is a &GAP; string, <A>offset</A> is an offset
within this string (zero based), and <A>count</A> is the maximal number 
of bytes to read. The data is read and stored into the string <A>st</A>,
starting at position <M><A>offset</A>+1</M>. The string <A>st</A> is 
made long enough, such that <A>count</A> bytes would fit into it, beginning
at position <M><A>offset</A>+1</M>. The number of bytes read is returned
or <C>fail</C> in case of an error. <P/>

The <C>write</C> function is similar, it also takes four arguments:
<A>fd</A> is an integer file descriptor, <A>st</A> is a &GAP; string,
<A>offset</A> is an offset within this string (zero based), and 
<A>count</A> is the number of bytes to write, starting from position
<M><A>offset</A>+1</M> in the string <A>st</A>. The number of bytes
written is returned, or a <C>fail</C> in case of an error. <P/>

The <C>opendir</C> function only returns <C>true</C> or <C>fail</C>. <P/>

The <C>readdir</C> function takes no argument. It reads the directory that
was specified in the last call to <C>opendir</C>. It just returns a string,
which is the name of a file or subdirectory in the corresponding directory.
It returns <C>false</C> after the last file name in the directory or
<C>fail</C> in case of an error. <P/>

The <C>closedir</C> function takes no argument. It should be called after
<C>readdir</C> returned <C>false</C> or <C>fail</C> to avoid excessive
use of file descriptors. <P/>

The functions <C>stat</C>, <C>fstat</C>, and <C>lstat</C> only take one
argument and return a &GAP; record that has the same entries as
a <C>struct stat</C>.<P/>

The function <C>socket</C> can optionally take a string as third argument.
In that case it automatically calls <C>getprotobyname</C> to look up the
protocol name.<P/>

The functions <C>bind</C> and <C>connect</C> take only one string argument
as address field, because the string already encodes the length.<P/>

There are two convenience functions <Ref Func="IO_make_sockaddr_in"/> and
<Ref Func="IO_MakeIPAddressPort"/> to create such addresses. The first takes
two arguments <A>addr</A> and <A>port</A>, where <A>addr</A> is
a string of length 4, containing the 4 bytes of the IP address and
<A>port</A> is a port number as &GAP; integer. The function
<Ref Func="IO_MakeIPAddressPort"/> takes the same arguments, but the first can
be a string containing an IP address in dot notation like
<Q>137.226.152.77</Q> or a hostname to be looked up.<P/>

The <C>setsockopt</C> function has no argument <A>optlen</A>. The length
of the string <A>optval</A> is taken.<P/>

The <C>select</C> function works as the function <C>UNIXSelect</C> in the
&GAP; library.<P/>

As of now, the file locking mechanisms of <C>fcntl</C> using 
<C>struct flock</C> are not yet implemented on the &GAP; level.
</Section>

<Section>
    <Heading>The low-level functions in detail</Heading>

Nearly all of this functions return an integer result in the C library.
On the &GAP; level this is either returned as a non-negative integer
in case of success or as <K>fail</K> in case of an error (where on the
C level <M>-1</M> would be returned). If the integer can only be <M>0</M>
for <Q>no error</Q> this is changed to <K>true</K> on the &GAP; level.

<Chapter Label="bufio">
<Heading>High level functions for buffered I/O</Heading>

The functions in the previous sections are intended to be a possibility
for direct access to the low level I/O functions in the C library. Thus,
the calling conventions are strictly as in the original.<P/>

The functionality described in this section is implemented completely
in the &GAP; language and is intended to provide a good interface
for programming in &GAP;. The fundamental object for I/O on the C library
level is the file descriptor, which is just a non-negative integer
representing an open file of the process. The basic idea is to wrap up
file descriptors in &GAP; objects that do the buffering.<P/>

Note that considerable care has been taken to ensure that one can
do I/O multiplexing with buffered I/O. That is, one always has the 
possibility to make sure before a read or write operation, that this
read or write operation will not block. This is crucial when one
wants to serve more than one I/O channel from the same (single-threaded)
&GAP; process. This design principle sometimes made it necessary
to have more than one function for a certain operation. Those
functions usually differ in a subtle way with respect to their
blocking behaviour.<P/>

One remark applies again to nearly all functions presented here: If an
error is indicated by the returned value <K>fail</K> one can use the
library function <Ref Func="LastSystemError" BookName="ref"/> to find
out more about the cause of the error. This fact is not mentioned with
every single function.

<Section>
    <Heading>Types and the creation of <C>File</C> objects</Heading>

The wrapped file objects are in the following category:

<ManSection>
<Filt Name="IsFile" Arg="o" Type="Category"/>
<Returns> <K>true</K> or <K>false</K> </Returns>
<Description> The category of <C>File</C> objects. </Description>
</ManSection>

To create objects in this category, one uses the following function:

<ManSection>
<Func Name="IO_WrapFD" Arg="fd, rbufsize, wbufsize" 
      Comm="creates buffering I/O objects, called File objects"/>
<Returns> a <C>File</C> object </Returns>
<Description>
The argument <A>fd</A> must be a file descriptor (i.e. an integer)
or -1 (see below). <P/>

<A>rbufsize</A> can either be <K>false</K> for
unbuffered reading or an integer buffer size or a string. If it is
an integer, a read buffer of that size is used. If it is a string,
then <A>fd</A> must be -1 and a <C>File</C> object that reads from that string
is created.<P/>

<A>wbufsize</A> can either be <K>false</K> for
unbuffered writing or an integer buffer size or a string. If it is
an integer, a write buffer of that size is used. If it is a string,
then <A>fd</A> must be -1 and a <C>File</C> object that appends to that string
is created.<P/>

The result of this function is a new <C>File</C> object.
</Description>
</ManSection>

A convenient way to do this for reading or writing of files on disk
is the following function:
<ManSection>
<Func Name="IO_File" Arg="filename [,mode]"
      Comm="open a file for reading or writing and create a File object"
      Label="mode" />
<Func Name="IO_File" Arg="filename [,bufsize]"
      Comm="open a file for reading or writing and create a File object"
      Label="bufsize" />
<Func Name="IO_File" Arg="filename,mode,bufsize"
      Comm="open a file for reading or writing and create a File object"
      Label="mode and bufsize" />
<Returns> a <C>File</C> object or <K>fail</K> </Returns>
<Description>
The argument <A>filename</A> must be a string specifying the path name
of the file to work on. <A>mode</A> must also be a string with possible
values <Q>r</Q>, <Q>w</Q>, or <Q>a</Q>, meaning read access, write
access (with creating and truncating), and append access respectively.
If <A>mode</A> is omitted, it defaults to <Q>r</Q>. <A>bufsize</A>, if given,
must be a positive integer or <C>false</C>, otherwise it defaults to 
<C>IO.DefaultBufSize</C>. 
Internally, the
<Ref Func="IO_open"/> function is used and the result file descriptor is 
wrapped using <Ref Func="IO_WrapFD"/> with <A>bufsize</A>
as the buffer size. <P/>

The result is either <K>fail</K> in case of an error or a <C>File</C> object
in case of success.
</Description>
</ManSection>

Note that there is a similar function <Ref Func="IO_FilteredFile"/> which 
also creates a <C>File</C> object but with additional functionality with
respect to a pipeline for filtering. It is described in its section
in Section <Ref Sect="ipc"/>. There is some more low-level functionality
to acquire open file descriptors. These can be wrapped into <C>File</C>
objects using <Ref Func="IO_WrapFD"/>.

</Section>
<Section>
    <Heading>Reading and writing</Heading>

Once a <C>File</C> object is created, one can use the following
functions on it:

<ManSection>
<Func Name="IO_ReadUntilEOF" Arg="f"
      Comm="buffered read until end of file"/>
<Returns> a string or <K>fail</K> </Returns>
<Description>
This function reads all data from the file <A>f</A> until the end of file.
The data is returned as a &GAP; string. If the file is already at end of
file, an empty string is returned. If an error occurs, then <K>fail</K> is
returned. Note that you still have to call <Ref Func="IO_Close"/> on the
<C>File</C> object to properly close the file later.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Func Name="IO_ReadBlock" Arg="f, len"
      Comm="buffered read from File object, blocking"/>
<Returns> a string or <K>fail</K> </Returns>
<Description>
This function gets two arguments, the first argument <A>f</A> must be
a <C>File</C> object and the second argument <A>len</A> must be
a positive integer. The function tries to read <A>len</A> bytes
and returns a string of that length. If and only if the end of file is 
reached earlier, fewer bytes are returned. If an error occurs, <K>fail</K>
is returned. Note that this function blocks until either <A>len</A> bytes
are read, or the end of file is reached, or an error occurs. For the case
of pipes or internet connections it is possible that currently no more
data is available, however, by definition the end of file is only reached 
after the connection has been closed by the other side!
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Func Name="IO_ReadLine" Arg="f"
      Comm="buffered read from File object, one line"/>
<Returns> a string or <K>fail</K> </Returns>
<Description>
This function gets exactly one argument, which must be a <C>File</C> object
<A>f</A>. It reads one line of data, where the definition of line is
operating system dependent. The line end character(s) are included in
the result. The function returns a string with the line in case of
success and <K>fail</K> in case of an error. In the
latter case, one can query the error with <Ref Func="LastSystemError"
BookName="ref"/>.<P/>

Note that the reading is done via the buffer of <A>f</A>, such that
this function will be quite fast also for large amounts of data.<P/>

If the end of file is hit without a line end, the rest of the file
is returned. If the file is already at end of file before the call,
then a string of length 0 is returned. Note that this
is not an error but the standard end of file convention!
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Func Name="IO_ReadLines" Arg="f [,max]"
      Comm="buffered read from File object, many lines"/>
<Returns> a list of strings or <K>fail</K> </Returns>
<Description>
This function gets one or two arguments, the first of which must always
be a <C>File</C> object <A>f</A>. It reads lines of data (where the
definition of line is operating system dependent) either until
end of file (without a second argument) or up to <A>max</A> lines
(with a second argument <A>max</A>. A list of strings with the result is
returned, if everything went well and <K>fail</K> oterwise. In the
latter case, one can query the error with <Ref Func="LastSystemError"
BookName="ref"/>.<P/>

Note that the reading is done via the buffer of <A>f</A>, such that
this function will be quite fast also for large amounts of data.<P/>

If the file is already at the end of file, the function returns
a list of length 0. Note that this is not an error but the standard end of
file convention!
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Func Name="IO_HasData" Arg="f"/>
<Returns> <K>true</K> or <K>false</K> </Returns>
<Description>
This function takes one argument <A>f</A> which must be a <C>File</C>
object. It returns <K>true</K> or <K>false</K> according to whether
there is data to read available in the file <A>f</A>. A return value
of <K>true</K> guarantees that the next call to <Ref Func="IO_Read"/>
on that file will succeed without blocking and return at least one
byte or an empty string to indicate the end of file.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Func Name="IO_Read" Arg="f, len"
      Comm="buffered read from File object"/>
<Returns> a string or <K>fail</K> </Returns>
<Description>
The function gets two arguments, the first of which must 
be a <C>File</C> object <A>f</A>. The second argument must be a positive
integer. The function reads data
up to <A>len</A> bytes.
A string with the result is returned, if everything
went well and <K>fail</K> otherwise. In the latter case, one can query
the error with <Ref Func="LastSystemError" BookName="ref"/>.<P/>

Note that the reading is done via the buffer of <A>f</A>, such that
this function will be quite fast also for large amounts of data.<P/>

If the file is already at the end of the file, the function returns
a string of length 0. Note that this is not an error!<P/>

If a previous call to <Ref Func="IO_HasData"/> or to <Ref Func="IO_Select"/>
indicated that there is data available to read, then it is guaranteed that
the function <Ref Func="IO_Read"/> does not block and returns at least
one byte if the file is not yet at end of file and an empty string
otherwise.

<Func Name="IO_Write" Arg="f [,things ... ]"
      Comm="buffered write to File object"/>
<Returns> an integer or <K>fail</K> </Returns>
<Description>
This function can get an arbitrary number of arguments, the first of which
must be a <C>File</C> object <A>f</A>. All the other arguments are just
written to <A>f</A> if they are strings. Otherwise, the <K>String</K>
function is called on them and the result is written out to <A>f</A>.<P/>

Note that the writing is done buffered. That is, the data is first written
to the buffer and only really written out after the buffer is full or
after the user explicitly calls <Ref Func="IO_Flush"/> on <A>f</A>.<P/>

The result is either the number of bytes written in case of success or
<K>fail</K> in case of an error. In the latter case the error can be
queried with <Ref Func="LastSystemError" BookName="ref"/>.<P/>

Note that this function blocks until all data is at least written into
the buffer and might block until data can be sent again if the buffer is
full.

<ManSection>
<Func Name="IO_WriteLine" Arg="f, line"
      Comm="buffered write to File object, one line"/>
<Returns> an integer or <K>fail</K> </Returns>
<Description>
Behaves like <Ref Func="IO_Write"/> but works on a single string
<A>line</A> and sends an (operating system dependent) end of line
string afterwards. Also <Ref Func="IO_Flush"/> is called automatically
after the operation, such that one can be sure, that the data is actually
written out after the function has completed.

</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Func Name="IO_WriteLines" Arg="f, list"
      Comm="buffered write to File object, many lines"/>
<Returns> an integer or <K>fail</K> </Returns>
<Description>
Behaves like <Ref Func="IO_Write"/> but works on a list of strings
<A>list</A> and sends an (operating system dependent) end of line
string after each string in the list. Also <Ref Func="IO_Flush"/> is
called automatically after the operation, such that one can be sure,
that the data is actually written out after the function has completed.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Func Name="IO_Flush" Arg="f"
      Comm="writes stuff in the buffer to the file"/>
<Returns> <K>true</K> or <K>fail</K> </Returns>
<Description>
This function gets one argument <A>f</A>, which must be a <C>File</C>
object. It writes out all the data that is in the write buffer. This
is not necessary before the call to the function <Ref Func="IO_Close"/>,
since that function calls <Ref Func="IO_Flush"/> automatically.
However, it is necessary to call <Ref Func="IO_Flush"/> after calls to
<Ref Func="IO_Write"/> to be sure that the data is really sent out. The
function returns <K>true</K> if everything goes well and <K>fail</K>
if an error occurs.<P/>

Remember that the functions <Ref Func="IO_WriteLine"/> and <Ref
Func="IO_WriteLines"/> implicitly call <Ref Func="IO_Flush"/> after
they are done.<P/>

Note that this function might block until all data is actually written
to the file descriptor.
</Description>

<ManSection>
<Func Name="IO_WriteFlush" Arg="f [,things]"/>
<Returns> an integer or <K>fail</K> </Returns>
<Description>
This function behaves like <Ref Func="IO_Write"/> followed by a call to

or <K>fail</K> if an error occurs.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Func Name="IO_ReadyForWrite" Arg="f"/>
<Returns> <K>true</K> or <K>false</K> </Returns>
<Description>
This function takes one argument <A>f</A> which must be a <C>File</C>
object. It returns <K>true</K> or <K>false</K> according to whether
the file <A>f</A> is ready to write. A return value
of <K>true</K> guarantees that the next call to <Ref
Func="IO_WriteNonBlocking"/>
on that file will succeed without blocking and accept at least one
byte.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Func Name="IO_WriteNonBlocking" Arg="f, st, pos, len"/>
<Returns> an integer or <K>fail</K> </Returns>
<Description>
This function takes four arguments. The first one <A>f</A> must be
a <C>File</C> object, the second <A>st</A> a string, and the arguments
<A>pos</A> and <A>len</A> must be integers, such that positions
<M><A>pos</A>+1</M> until <M><A>pos</A>+<A>len</A></M> are bound in
<A>st</A>. The function tries to write up to <A>len</A> bytes from
<A>st</A> from position <M><A>pos</A>+1</M> to the file <A>f</A>.
If a previous call to <Ref Func="IO_ReadyForWrite"/> or to <Ref
Func="IO_Select"/> indicates that <A>f</A> is writable, then it is
guaranteed that the following call to <Ref Func="IO_WriteNonBlocking"/>
will not block and accept at least one byte of data. Note that it is not
guaranteed that all <A>len</A> bytes are written. The function returns
the number of bytes written or <K>fail</K> if an error occurs.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Func Name="IO_ReadyForFlush" Arg="f"/>
<Returns> <K>true</K> or <K>false</K> </Returns>
<Description>
This function takes one argument <A>f</A> which must be a <C>File</C>
object. It returns <K>true</K> or <K>false</K> according to whether
the file <A>f</A> is ready to flush. A return value
of <K>true</K> guarantees that the next call to <Ref
Func="IO_FlushNonBlocking"/>
on that file will succeed without blocking and flush out at least one
byte. Note that this does not guarantee, that this call succeeds to
flush out the whole content of the buffer!
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Func Name="IO_FlushNonBlocking" Arg="f"/>
<Returns> <K>true</K>, <K>false</K>, or <K>fail</K> </Returns>
<Description>
This function takes one argument <A>f</A> which must be a <C>File</C>
object. It tries to write all data in the writing buffer to the file
descriptor. If this succeeds, the function returns <K>true</K> and
<K>false</K> otherwise. If an error occurs, <K>fail</K> is returned.
If a previous call to <Ref Func="IO_ReadyForFlush"/> or <Ref
Func="IO_Select"/> indicated that <A>f</A> is flushable, then it is
guaranteed that the following call to <Ref Func="IO_FlushNonBlocking"/>
does not block. However, it is not guaranteed that <K>true</K> is returned
from that call.

<Returns> <K>true</K> or <K>fail</K> </Returns>
<Description>
This function closes the <C>File</C> object <A>f</A> after writing all data
in the write buffer out and closing the file descriptor. All buffers are
freed. In case of an error, the function returns <K>fail</K> and otherwise
<K>true</K>. Note that for pipes to other processes this function collects
data about the terminated processes using <Ref Func="IO_WaitPid"/>.

<ManSection>
<Func Name="IO_GetWBuf" Arg="f"
      Comm="returns the writing buffer as a string"/>
<Returns> a string or <K>false</K> </Returns>
<Description>
This function gets one argument <A>f</A> which must be a <C>File</C> object
and returns the writing buffer of that <C>File</C> object. This is
necessary for <C>File</C> objects, that are not associated to a
real file descriptor but just collect everything that was written
in their writing buffer. Remember to use this function before closing
the <C>File</C> object.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Func Name="IO_Select" Arg="r, w, f, e, t1, t2"/>
<Returns> an integer or <K>fail</K> </Returns>
<Description>
This function is the corresponding function to <Ref Func="IO_select"/>
for buffered file access. It behaves similarly to that function. The
differences are the following: There are four lists of files <A>r</A>,
<A>w</A>, <A>f</A>, and <A>e</A>. They all can contain either integers
(standing for file descriptors) or <C>File</C> objects. The list <A>r</A>
is for checking, whether files or file descriptors are ready to read, the 
list <A>w</A> is for checking whether they are ready to write, the
list <A>f</A> is for checking whether they are ready to flush, and
the list <A>e</A> is for checking whether they have exceptions.<P/>

For <C>File</C> objects it is always first checked, whether there is either
data available in a reading buffer or space in a writing buffer. If so,
they are immediately reported to be ready (this feature makes the
list of <C>File</C> objects to test for flushability necessary). 
For the remaining files and for
all specified file descriptors, the function <Ref Func="IO_select"/> is
called to get an overview about readiness. The timeout values <A>t1</A>
and <A>t2</A> are set to zero for immediate returning if one of the
requested buffers were ready.<P/>

<Ref Func="IO_Select"/> returns the number of files or file descriptors
that are ready to serve or <K>fail</K> if an error occurs.

The following function is a convenience function for directory access:

<ManSection>
<Func Name="IO_ListDir" Arg="pathname"
      Comm="returns a list of file names in the directory pathname"/>
<Returns> a list of strings or <K>fail</K> </Returns>
<Description>
This function gets a string containing a path name as single argument
and returns a list of strings that are the names of the files in that
directory, or <K>fail</K>, if an error occurred.
</Description>

The following function is used to create strings describing a pair of
an IP address and a port number in a binary way. These strings can be
used in connection with the C library functions <C>connect</C>,
<C>bind</C>, <C>recvfrom</C>, and <C>sendto</C> for the arguments
needing such address pairs.

<ManSection>
<Func Name="IO_MakeIPAddressPort" Arg="ipstring, portnr"
      Comm="creates an IP address port number pair for usage with connect"/>
<Returns> a string </Returns>
<Description>
This function gets a string <A>ipstring</A> containing an IP address
in dot notation, i.e. four numbers in the range from 0 to 255 separated
by dots <Q>.</Q>, and an integer <A>portnr</A>, which is a port number.
The result is a string of the correct length to be used for the
low level C library functions, wherever IP address port number pairs
are needed. The string <A>ipstring</A> can also be a host name, which
is then looked up using <Ref Func="IO_gethostbyname"/> to find the IP
address.

<Description>
Takes no arguments, uses <Ref Func="IO_environ"/> to get the environment
and returns a record in which the component names are the names of the
environment variables and the values are the values. This can then be
changed and the changed record can be given to <Ref Func="IO_MakeEnvList"/>
to produce again a list which can be used for <Ref Func="IO_execve"/> as
third argument.

<Func Name="IO_FindExecutable" Arg="path"/>
<Returns> <K>fail</K> or the path to an executable </Returns>
<Description>
If the path name <A>path</A> contains a slash, this function simply
checks whether the string <A>path</A> refers to an executable file. If so, 
<A>path</A> is returned as is. Otherwise, <K>fail</K> is returned.
If the path name <A>path</A> does not contain a slash, all directories
in the environment variable <F>PATH</F> are searched for an executable
with name <A>path</A>. If so, the full path to that executable is 
returned, otherwise <K>fail</K>.<P/>

This function is used whenever one of the following functions gets an
argument that should refer to an executable.

<Func Name="IO_Popen" Arg="path, argv, mode"
      Comm="Starts a child process with either stdout or stdin being a pipe"/>
<Returns> a <C>File</C> object or <K>fail</K> </Returns>
<Description>
The argument <A>path</A> must refer to an executable file in the sense
of <Ref Func="IO_FindExecutable"/>. <P/>

Starts a child process using the executable in <A>path</A>
with either stdout or stdin being a pipe. The 
argument <A>mode</A> must be either the string <Q><C>r</C></Q> or the
string <Q><C>w</C></Q>. <P/>

In the first case, the standard output of the
child process will be the writing end of a pipe. A <C>File</C> object
for reading connected to the reading end of the pipe is returned. The
standard input and standard error of the child process will be the same
than the calling &GAP; process. <P/>

In the second case, the standard input of the child process will be the
reading end of a pipe. A <C>File</C> object for writing connected to the
writing end of the pipe is returned. The standard output and standard error 
of the child process will be the same than the calling &GAP; process. <P/>

In case of an error, <K>fail</K> is returned. <P/>

The process will usually die, when the pipe is closed, but can also
do so without that. The <C>File</C> object remembers the process ID
of the started process and the <Ref Func="IO_Close"/> function then
calls <Ref Func="IO_WaitPid"/> for it to acquire information about
the terminated process. <P/>
Note that <Ref Func="IO_Popen"/> activates our SIGCHLD handler (see <Ref
Func="IO_InstallSIGCHLDHandler"/>). <P/>

In either case the <C>File</C> object will have the attribute
<Q><K>ProcessID</K></Q> set to the process ID of the child process.

<Func Name="IO_Popen2" Arg="path, argv"
      Comm="Starts a child process with stdin and stdout being a pipe"/>
<Returns> a record or <K>fail</K> </Returns>
<Description>
The argument <A>path</A> must refer to an executable file in the sense
of <Ref Func="IO_FindExecutable"/>. <P/>

A new child process is started using the executable in <A>path</A>
The standard input and standard output of it 
are pipes. The writing end of the input pipe and the reading end of the
output pipe are returned as <C>File</C> objects bound to two components
<Q><C>stdin</C></Q> and <Q><C>stdout</C></Q> (resp.) of the returned record. 
This means, you have to <E>write</E> to <Q><C>stdin</C></Q> and <E>read</E> 
from <Q><C>stdout</C></Q> in the calling &GAP; process. 
The standard error of the child process will be 
the same as the one of the calling &GAP; process. <P/>

Returns <K>fail</K> if an error occurred. <P/>

The process will usually die, when one of the pipes is closed. The <C>File</C>
objects remember the process ID of the called process and the function
call to <Ref Func="IO_Close"/> for the <C>stdout</C> object will call
<Ref Func="IO_WaitPid"/> for it to acquire information about the
terminated process. <P/>
Note that <Ref Func="IO_Popen2"/> activates our SIGCHLD handler (see <Ref
Func="IO_InstallSIGCHLDHandler"/>). <P/>

Both <C>File</C> objects will have the attribute <Q><K>ProcessID</K></Q>
set to the process ID of the child process, which will also be bound to
the <Q><K>pid</K></Q> component of the returned record.

<Func Name="IO_Popen3" Arg="path, argv"
   Comm="Starts a child process with stdin, stdout, and stderr being a pipe"/>
<Returns> a record or <K>fail</K> </Returns>
<Description>
The argument <A>path</A> must refer to an executable file in the sense
of <Ref Func="IO_FindExecutable"/>. <P/>

A new child process is started using the executable in <A>path</A>
The standard input, standard output, and standard error of it 
are pipes. The writing end of the input pipe, the reading end of the
output pipe and the reading end of the error pipe 
are returned as <C>File</C> objects bound to two components
<Q><C>stdin</C></Q>, <Q><C>stdout</C></Q>, and <Q><C>stderr</C></Q> 
(resp.) of the returned record. 
This means, you have to <E>write</E> to <Q><C>stdin</C></Q> and <E>read</E> 
from <Q><C>stdout</C></Q> and <Q><C>stderr</C></Q> in the calling
&GAP; process.<P/>

Returns <K>fail</K> if an error occurred. <P/>

The process will usually die, when one of the pipes is closed. All three
<C>File</C> objects will remember the process ID of the newly created
process and the call to the <Ref Func="IO_Close"/> function for the
<C>stdout</C> object will call <Ref Func="IO_WaitPid"/> for it to acquire
information about the terminated child process. <P/>
Note that <Ref Func="IO_Popen3"/> activates our SIGCHLD handler (see <Ref
Func="IO_InstallSIGCHLDHandler"/>). <P/>

All three <C>File</C> objects will have the attribute <Q><K>ProcessID</K></Q>
set to the process ID of the child process, which will also be bound to
the <Q><K>pid</K></Q> component of the returned record.

<Func Name="IO_StartPipeline" Arg="progs, infd, outfd, switcherror"/>
<Returns> a record or <K>fail</K> </Returns>
<Description>
    The argument <A>progs</A> is a list of pairs, the first entry being a 
    path to an executable (in the sense of <Ref Func="IO_FindExecutable"/>), 
    the second an argument list, the argument
    <A>infd</A> is an open file descriptor for
    reading, <A>outfd</A> is an open file descriptor for writing, both can be
    replaced by the string <Q><K>open</K></Q> in which case a new pipe will 
    be opened. The argument <A>switcherror</A>
is a boolean indicating whether standard error channels are also
switched to the corresponding output channels. <P/>
This function starts up all processes
and connects them with pipes. The input of the first is switched to
<A>infd</A> and the output of the last to <A>outfd</A>.
<P/>
Returns a record with the following components: <K>pids</K> is a list of 
process ids if everything worked. For each process for which
some error occurred the corresponding pid is replaced by <K>fail</K>.
The <K>stdin</K> component is equal to <K>false</K>, or to the file descriptor
of the writing end of the newly created pipe which is connected to the
standard input of the first of the new processes if 
<A>infd</A> was <Q><K>open</K></Q>.
The <K>stdout</K> component is equal to <K>false</K> or to the file
descriptor of the reading end of the newly created pipe which is connected
to the standard output of the last of the new processes if <A>outfd</A> was 
<Q><K>open</K></Q>.
<P/>
Note that the SIGCHLD handler of the <Package>IO</Package> package is installed
by this function (see <Ref Func="IO_InstallSIGCHLDHandler"/>) and that it 
lies in the responsibility of the caller to use <Ref Func="IO_WaitPid"/>
to ask for the status information of all child processes after their
termination.

    is created by the processes described by <A>progs</A> (see <Ref
        Func="IO_StartPipeline"/>) to filter the content of the file

    Writes the content of the string <A>st</A> to the file with the name 
    <A>filename</A>, however, a pipeline
    is created by the processes described by <A>progs</A> (see <Ref

<Func Name="IO_FilteredFile" Arg="progs, filename [,mode][,bufsize]"/>

<Description>
    This function is similar to <Ref Func="IO_File" Label="mode"/> 
    and behaves nearly
identically. The only difference is that a filtering pipeline is switched
between the file and the <C>File</C> object such that all things read
or written respectively are filtered through this pipeline of processes.
<P/>
The <C>File</C> object remembers the started processes and upon the
final call to <Ref Func="IO_Close"/> automatically uses the
<Ref Func="IO_WaitPid"/> function to acquire information from the
terminated processes in the pipeline after their termination. This means
that you do not have to call <Ref Func="IO_WaitPid"/> any more after
the call to <Ref Func="IO_Close"/>.<P/>
Note that <Ref Func="IO_FilteredFile"/> activates our SIGCHLD handler (see <Ref
    Func="IO_InstallSIGCHLDHandler"/>).<P/>
The <C>File</C> object will have the attribute
<Q><K>ProcessID</K></Q> set to the list of process IDs of the child processes.

<ManSection>
<Func Name="IO_SendStringBackground" Arg="f, st"
      Comm="Sends away the string st to f in the background"/>
<Description>
This functions uses <Ref Func="IO_Write"/> to write the whole string
<A>st</A> to the <C>File</C> object <A>f</A>. However, this is done
by forking off a child process identical to the calling &GAP; process
that does the sending. The calling &GAP; process returns immediately, even 
before anything has been sent away with the result <K>true</K>. 
The forked off sender process terminates itself immediately after it
has sent all data away.<P/>

The reason for having this function available is the following: If one 
uses <Ref Func="IO_Popen2"/> or <Ref Func="IO_Popen3"/> to start up
a child process with standard input and standard output being a pipe,
then one usually has the problem, that the child process starts reading
some data, but then wants to write data, before it received all data
coming. If the calling &GAP; process would first try to write all data
and only start to read the output of the
child process after sending away all data, 
a deadlock situation would occur.
This is avoided with the forking and backgrounding approach.<P/>

Remember to close the writing end of the standard input pipe in the
calling &GAP; process directly after <Ref Func="IO_SendStringBackground"/>
has returned, because otherwise the child process might not notice that
all data has arrived, because the pipe persists! See the file
<F>popen2.g</F> in the <F>example</F> directory for an example.<P/>

Note that with most modern operating systems the forking off of an
identical child process does in fact <E>not</E> mean a duplication of the
total main memory used by both processes, because the operating system
kernel will use <Q>copy on write</Q>. However, if a garbage collection
happens to become necessary during the sending of the data in the
forked off sending process, this might trigger doubled memory usage.

The functions returns either <K>fail</K> if an error occurred, or otherwise
a record with components <K>out</K> and <K>err</K> which are bound
to strings containing the full standard output and standard error
of the called process.

    <Heading>Object serialisation (Pickling)</Heading>

The idea of <Q>object serialisation</Q> is that one wants to store
nearly arbitrary &GAP; objects to disk or transfer them over the network.
To this end, one wants to convert them to a byte stream that is platform
independent and can later be converted back to a copy of the same object
in memory, be it in the same &GAP; process or another one maybe even on
another machine. The main problem here are the vast amount of different
types occurring in &GAP; and the possibly highly self-referential
structure of &GAP; objects.

<P/>
The <Package>IO</Package> package contains a framework to implement object
serialisation and implementations for most of the basic data types
in &GAP;. The framework is easily extendible to other types and takes
complete care of self-references and corresponding problems.
It builds upon the buffered I/O functions described in Section
<Ref Sect="bufio"/>. We start by describing the user interface.<P/>

<Section>
    <Heading>Result objects</Heading>

The following static objects are used to report about success or
failure of the (un-)pickling operations:

<ManSection>
<Var Name="IO_Error"/>
<Description> This object is returned if an error occurs. </Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Var Name="IO_Nothing"/>
<Description> This object is returned when there 
is nothing to return, for example if an unpickler (see <Ref
Oper="IO_Unpickle"/>) encounters the end of a file.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Var Name="IO_OK"/>
<Description> This object is returned if everything went well and there is
no other canonical value to return to indicate this.
</Description>
</ManSection>

The only thing you can do with these special values is to compare them
to each other and to other objects.<P/>

</Section>

<Section>
    <Heading>Pickling and unpickling</Heading>

<ManSection>
    <Oper Name="IO_Pickle" Arg="f, ob"/>
    <Returns> <C>IO&uscore;OK</C> or <C>IO&uscore;Error</C> </Returns>
    <Description>
        The argument <A>f</A> must be an open, writable <C>File</C>
        object. The object <A>ob</A> can be an arbitrary &GAP; object.
        The operation <Q>pickles</Q> or <Q>serialises</Q> the object
        <A>ob</A> and writes the result into the <C>File</C> object
        <A>f</A>. If everything is OK, the unique value <C>IO&uscore;OK</C>
        is returned and otherwise the unique value <C>IO&uscore;Error</C>.
        The resulting byte stream can be read again using the operation
        <Ref Oper="IO_Unpickle"/> and is platform- and architecture
        independent. Especially the question whether a system has
        32 bit or 64 bit wide words and the question of endianess
        does not matter. 
        <P/>
        Note that not all of &GAP;'s object types are supported but it
        is relatively easy to extend the system. This package supports
        in particular boolean values, integers, permutations, rational
        numbers, finite field elements, cyclotomics, strings, polynomials,
        rational functions,
        lists, records, compressed vectors and matrices over finite fields
        (objects are uncompressed in the byte stream but recompressed
        during unpickling), and straight line programs.
        <P/>
        Self-referential objects built from records and lists are handled
        correctly and are restored completely with the same self-references
        during unpickling.
    </Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
    <Oper Name="IO_Unpickle" Arg="f"/>
    <Returns> <C>IO&uscore;Error</C> or a &GAP; object </Returns>
    <Description>
        The argument <A>f</A> must be an open, readable <C>File</C>
        object. The operation reads from <A>f</A> and <Q>unpickles</Q>
        the next object. If an error occurs, the unique value 
        <C>IO&uscore;Error</C>
        is returned. If the <C>File</C>
        object is at end of file, the value <C>IO&uscore;Nothing</C> is returned.
        Note that these two values are not picklable, because of
        their special meaning as return values of this operation here. 
    </Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
    <Func Name="IO_ClearPickleCache" Arg=""/>
    <Returns> Nothing </Returns>
    <Description>
        This function clears the <Q>pickle cache</Q>. This cache stores all
        object pickled in the current recursive call to <Ref Oper="IO_Pickle"/>
        and is necessary to handle self-references. Usually it is not
        necessary to call this function explicitly. Only in the rare
        case (that should not happen) that a pickling or unpickling operation
        enters a break loop which is left by the user, the pickle
        cache has to be cleared explicitly using this function for
        later calls to <Ref Oper="IO_Pickle"/> and <Ref Oper="IO_Unpickle"/>
        to work!
    </Description>
</ManSection>

</Section>

<Section Label="ExtPickFrame">
<Heading>Extending the pickling framework</Heading>

The framework can be extended for other &GAP; object types as follows:

<P/>
For pickling, a method for the operation <Ref Oper="IO_Pickle"/> has
to be installed which does the work. If the object to be pickled has
subobjects, then the first action of the method is to call the function
<C>IO&uscore;AddToPickled</C> with the object as argument. This will put it
into the pickle cache and take care of self-references. Arbitrary
subobjects can then be pickled using recursive calls to the operation
<Ref Oper="IO_Pickle"/> handing down the same <C>File</C> object into
the recursion. The method must either return <C>IO&uscore;Error</C> in case of
an error or <C>IO&uscore;OK</C> if everything goes well. Before returning,
a method that has called <C>IO&uscore;AddToPickled</C>
must call the function <C>IO&uscore;FinalizePickled</C> without
arguments <E>under all circumstances</E>. If this call is missing,
global data for the pickling procedure becomes corrupt!

<P/>
Every pickling method must first write a 4 byte magic value such that
later during unpickling of the byte stream the right unpickling
method can be called (see below). Then it can write arbitrary data,
however, this data should be platform- and architecture independent, and
it must be possible to unpickle it later without <Q>lookahead</Q>.

<P/>
Pickling methods should usually not go into a break loop, because
after leaving the user has to call <Ref Func="IO_ClearPickleCache"/>
explicitly!

<P/>
Unpickling is implemented as follows: For every 4 byte magic value
there must be a function bound to that value in the record
<C>IO&uscore;Unpicklers</C>. If the unpickling operation <Ref Oper="IO_Unpickle"/>
encounters that magic value, it calls the corresponding unpickling
function. This function just gets one <C>File</C> object as argument.
Since the magic value is already read, it can immediately start 
with reading and rebuilding the serialised object in memory. The method
has to take care to restore the object including its type completely.

<P/>
If an object type has subobjects, the unpickling function has to
first create a skeleton of the object without its subobjects, then
call <C>IO&uscore;AddToUnpickled</C> on this skeleton, <E>before</E> unpickling
subobjects. If things are not done in this order, the handling of 
self-references down in the recursion will not work! An unpickling 
function that has called <C>IO&uscore;AddToUnpickled</C> at the beginning
has to call <C>IO&uscore;FinalizeUnpickled</C> without arguments before
returning <E>under all circumstances</E>! If this call is missing,
global data for the unpickling procedure becomes corrupt!

<P/>
Of course, unpickling functions can recursively call <Ref Oper="IO_Unpickle"/>
to unpickle subobjects. Apart from this, unpickling functions can use
arbitrary reading functions on the <C>File</C> object. However, they
should only read sequentially and never move the current file position
pointer otherwise. An unpickling function should return the newly
created object or the value <C>IO&uscore;Error</C> if an error occurred.
They should never go into a break loop, because after leaving the user
has to call <Ref Func="IO_ClearPickleCache"/> explicitly!

<P/>
Perhaps the best way to learn how to extend the framework is to
study the code for the basic &GAP; objects in the file
<F>pkg/io/gap/pickle.gi</F>.

    <Heading>Really random sources</Heading>

    This section describes so called <Q>real random sources</Q>. It is an
    extension to the library mechanism of random source objects that uses
    the devices <F>/dev/random</F> and <F>/dev/urandom</F> available
    on <F>Linux</F> systems (and maybe on other operating systems) providing
    random numbers that are impossible to predict. The idea is that such
    sources of random numbers are useful to produce unpredictable
    secret keys for cryptographic applications.

    <Section>
        <Heading>The functions</Heading>

<ManSection>
<Meth Name="RandomSource" Arg="r,dev"/>
<Returns> a real random source object or <C>fail</C> </Returns>    
<Description>
    The first argument <A>r</A> must be the &GAP; filter 
    <C>IsRealRandomSource</C> and the second either the string
    <F>random</F> or the string <F>urandom</F>. A real
    random source object is created that draws its random numbers from
    the kernel devices <F>/dev/random</F> and <F>/dev/urandom</F>
    respectively. Whereas <F>/dev/urandom</F> always provides random
    numbers of not guaranteed <Q>quality</Q>, the device <F>/dev/random</F>
    measures its entropy and produces guaranteed unpredictable numbers.
    However, it might block until enough <Q>random</Q> events (like
    mouse movements) have been accumulated.

    <Heading>A client side implementation of the HTTP protocol</Heading>

The <Package>IO</Package> package contains an implementation of the client side
of the HTTP protocol. The basic purpose of this is of course to be
able to download data from web servers from the &GAP; language. However,
the HTTP protocol can perform a much bigger variety of tasks.

<Section>
    <Heading>Functions for client side HTTP</Heading>

<ManSection>
<Func Name="OpenHTTPConnection" Arg="hostname, port"/>
<Returns> a record </Returns>
<Description>
    The first argument <A>hostname</A> must be a string containing the 
    hostname of the server to connect. The second argument <A>port</A>
    must be an integer in the range from <M>1</M> to <M>65535</M> and
    describes the port to connect to on the server. <P/>
    The function opens a TCP/IP connection to the server and returns
    a record <K>conn</K> with the following components: 
    <K>conn.sock</K> is <K>fail</K> if an error occurs and otherwise
    a <C>File</C> object linked to the file descriptor of the
    socket. In case of an error, the component <K>conn.errormsg</K>
    contains an error message, it is otherwise empty. If everything
    went well then the component <K>conn.host</K> is the result from
    the host name lookup (see <Ref Func="IO_gethostbyname"/>) and the
    component <K>conn.closed</K> is set to <K>false</K>. <P/>
    No data is sent or received on the socket in this function.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Func Name="HTTPRequest" Arg="conn, method, uri, header, body, target"/>
<Returns> a record </Returns>
<Description>
    This function performs a complete HTTP request. The first argument must
    be a connection record as returned by a successful call to
    <Ref Func="OpenHTTPConnection"/>. The argument <A>method</A> must
    be a valid HTTP request <Q>method</Q> in form of a string. 
    The most common will be <K>GET</K>, <K>POST</K>, or <K>HEAD</K>.
    The argument <A>uri</A> is a string containing the URI of the
    request, which is given in the first line of the request. This will
    usually be a relative or absolute path name given to the server.
    The argument <A>header</A> must be a &GAP; record. Each bound field
    of this record will we transformed into one header line with the
    name of the component being the key and the value the value. All
    bound values must be strings. The argument <A>body</A> must either
    be a string or <K>false</K>. If it is a string, this string is sent
    away as the body of the request. If no string or an empty string is
    given, no body will be sent. The header field <K>Content-Length</K>
    is automatically created from the length of the string <A>body</A>.
    Finally, the argument <A>target</A> can either be <K>false</K> or
    a string. In the latter case, the body of the request answer
    is written to the file with the name given in <A>target</A>. The
    <K>body</K> component of the result will be the file name in this
    case. If <A>target</A> is false, the full body of the answer is
    stored into the <K>body</K> component of the result. <P/>
    The function sends away the request and awaits the answer. If anything
    goes wrong during the transfer (for example if the connection is
    broken prematurely), then the component <K>statuscode</K> of the
    resulting record is <M>0</M> and the component <K>status</K> is
    a corresponding error message. In that case, all other fields may
    or may not be bound to sensible values, according to when the
    error occurred. If everything goes well, then <K>statuscode</K> 
    and <K>status</K> are bound to the corresponding values coming from
    the request answer. <K>statuscode</K> is transformed into a &GAP; 
    integer. The header of the answer is parsed, transformed into
    a &GAP; record, and stored into the component <K>header</K> of the
    result. The <K>body</K> component of the result record is set
    as described above. Finally, the <K>protoversion</K> component
    contains the HTTP protocol version number used by the server as
    a string and the boolean value <K>closed</K> indicates, whether
    or not the function has detected, that the connection has been
    closed by the server. Note that by default, the connection will
    stay open, at least for a certain time after the end of the
    request.<P/>
    See the description of the global variable <Ref
    Var="HTTPTimeoutForSelect"/> for rules how timeouts are done in
    this function.
    <P/> Note that if the <A>method</A> is <K>HEAD</K>, then no body
    is expected (none will be sent anyway) and the function returns
    immediately with empty body. Of course, the <K>Content-Length</K>
    value in the header is as if it the request would be done with the
    <K>GET</K> method.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Var Name="HTTPTimeoutForSelect"/>
<Description>
This global variable holds a list of length two. By default, both entries
are <K>fail</K> indicating that <Ref Func="HTTPRequest"/> should never
timeout and wait forever for an answer. Actually, the two values in
this variable are given to the <Ref Func="IO_Select"/> function call
during I/O multiplexing. That is, the first number is in seconds and
the second in milliseconds. Together they lead to a timeout for the
HTTP request. If a timeout occurs, an error condition is triggered
which returns a record with status code <M>0</M> and status being
the timeout error message.<P/>
You can change the timeout by accessing the two entries of this
write protected list variable directly.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Func Name="CloseHTTPConnection" Arg="conn"/>
<Returns> nothing </Returns>
<Description>
    Closes the connection described by the connection record <A>conn</A>.
    No error can possibly occur.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Func Name="SingleHTTPRequest" 
      Arg="hostname, port, method, uri, header, body, target"/>
<Returns> a record </Returns>
<Description>
    The arguments are as the corresponding ones in the functions   
    <Ref Func="OpenHTTPConnection"/> and <Ref Func="HTTPRequest"/>
    respectively. This function opens an HTTP connection, tries
    a single HTTP request and immediately closes the connection
    again. The result is as for the <Ref Func="HTTPRequest"/>
    function. If an error occurs during the opening of the connection,
    the <K>statuscode</K> value of the result is <M>0</M> and the error
    message is stored in the <K>status</K> component of the result.
</Description>
</ManSection>

The previous function allows for a very simple implementation of a
function that checks, whether your current &GAP; installation is
up to date:

<ManSection>
<Func Name="CheckForUpdates" Arg=""/>
<Returns> nothing </Returns>
<Description>
    This function accesses a web page in St. Andrews and runs some
    &GAP; code from there. This code knows all the currently released
    versions of &GAP; and its packages. It prints out a summary and
    possibly suggests upgrades. If you do not want to executed
    code downloaded from the internet, then do not call this function.
    <P/>
    More concretely, the page accessed is
    <URL>http://www.gap-system.org/Download/upgrade.html</URL> and the
    code executed is a single call to the function <C>SuggestUpgrades</C> 
    function in the &GAP; library.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Func Name="ReadWeb" Arg="URL"/>
<Returns> nothing </Returns>
<Description>
    This function downloads the file from the given uniform resource
    locator <A>URL</A> using the HTTP protocol 
    and reads the contents into &GAP; using
    <Ref Func="Read" BookName="ref"/>.
    <P/>
    Note that this can execute arbitrary code on your machine with the
    privileges of the &GAP; job running, so you should be very careful
    what files you download and execute. You have been warned!

<Chapter>
<Heading>Background jobs using fork</Heading>

This chapter describes a way to use multi-processor or multi-core machines
from within &GAP;. In its current version the &GAP; system is a single
threaded and single process system. However, modern operating systems
allow, via the <C>fork</C> system call, to replicate a complete process
on the same machine relatively efficiently. That is, at first after
a <C>fork</C> the two processes actually use the same physical memory
such that not much copying needs to be done. The child process is in 
exactly the same state as the parent process, sharing open files, network 
connections and the complete status of the workspace. However, whenever
a page of memory is written, it is then automatically copied using new,
additional physical memory, such that it behaves like a completely separate
process. This method is called <Q>copy-on-write</Q>.

<P/>
Thus this is a method to parallelise certain computations. Note however, that
from the point of time when the <C>fork</C> has occurred, all further 
communication between the two processes has to be realised via pipes
or even files.

<P/>
The operations and methods described in this chapter help to use &GAP; in this
way and implement certain <Q>skeletons</Q> of parallel programming to
make these readily available in &GAP;. Note that this implementation
has its severe limitations and should probably eventually be replaced
by a proper multi-threaded version of &GAP;.

<Section>
<Heading>Background jobs</Heading>

One creates a background job with the following operation:

<ManSection>
<Oper Name="BackgroundJobByFork" Arg="fun, args [,opt]"/>
<Returns>a background job object or <K>fail</K></Returns>
<Description>
This operation creates a background job using <Ref Func="IO_fork"/>
which starts up as an identical copy of the currently running &GAP;
process. In this child process the function <A>fun</A> is called
with the argument list <A>args</A>. The third argument <A>opt</A>
must be a record for options. The operation returns either an object
representing the background job or <K>fail</K> if the startup did not
work.
<P/>
This operation automatically sets up two pipes for communication with
the child process. This is in particular used to report the result of
the function call to <A>fun</A> back to the parent. However, if called
without the option <C>TerminateImmediately</C> (see below) the child
process stays alive even after the completion of <A>fun</A> and one
can submit further argument lists for subsequent calls to <A>fun</A>.
Of course, these additional argument lists will have to be sent 
over a pipe to the child process. A special case is if the argument
<A>args</A> is equal to <K>fail</K>, in this case the child process is
started but does not automatically call <A>fun</A> but rather
waits in an idle state until an argument list is submitted via the
pipe using the <Ref Oper="Submit" Label="bgjob"/> operation described below.
<P/>
There are two components defined which can be bound in the options record
<A>opt</A>. One is <C>TerminateImmediately</C>, if this is bound to <K>true</K>
then the child process immediately terminates after the function <A>fun</A>
returns its result. In this case, no pipe for communication from parent
to child is created since it would never be used. Note that in this case
one can still get the result of the function <A>fun</A> using the
<Ref Oper="Pickup" Label="bgjob"/> operation described below, even when
the child has already terminated, since the result is first transmitted
back to the parent before termination.
</Description>
</ManSection>

The following operations are available to deal with background job
objects:

<ManSection>
<Oper Name="IsIdle" Arg="job" Label="bgjob"/>
<Returns><K>true</K>, <K>false</K> or <K>fail</K></Returns>
<Description>
This operation checks whether or not the background job represented by
the object <A>job</A> has already finished the function call to its
worker function and is now idle. If so, <K>true</K> is returned. If it
is still running and working on the worker function, <K>false</K> is returned.
If the background job has already terminated altogether, this operation
returns <K>fail</K>. Note that if a child process terminates automatically
after the first completion of its worker function and sending the result,
then the first call to <Ref Oper="IsIdle" Label="bgjob"/> 
after completion will return
<K>true</K> to indicate successful completion and all subsequent calls
will return <K>fail</K>.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Oper Name="HasTerminated" Arg="job"/>
<Returns><K>true</K> or <K>false</K></Returns>
<Description>
This operation checks whether or not the background job represented by
the object <A>job</A> has already terminated. 
If so, <K>true</K> is returned, if not, <K>false</K> is returned.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Oper Name="WaitUntilIdle" Arg="job"/>
<Returns>the result of the worker function or <K>fail</K></Returns>
<Description>
This operation waits until the worker function of the background job 
<A>job</A> has finished and the job is idle. It then returns the result
of the worker function, which has automatically been transmitted to
the parent process. If the child process has died before completion
<K>fail</K> is returned.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Oper Name="Pickup" Arg="job" Label="bgjob"/>
<Returns>the result of the worker function or <K>fail</K></Returns>
<Description>
This operation does the same as <Ref Oper="WaitUntilIdle"/>.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Oper Name="Submit" Arg="job, args" Label="bgjob"/>
<Returns><K>true</K> or <K>fail</K></Returns>
<Description>
This submits another argument list <A>args</A> for another call to the
worker function in the background job <A>job</A>. It is an error if
either the background job has already terminated or if it is still busy
working on the previous argument list. That is, one must only submit
another argument in a situation when <Ref Oper="IsIdle" Label="bgjob"/> 
would return
<K>true</K>. This is for example the case directly after a successful
call to <Ref Oper="Pickup" Label="bgjob"/> or i
<Ref Oper="WaitUntilIdle"/> which did
not return <K>fail</K>, unless the background job was created with the
<C>TerminateImmediately</C> option set to <K>true</K>.
<P/>
This operation returns immediately after submission, when the new argument 
list has been sent to the child process through a pipe. In particular, 
it does not await completion of the worker function for the new
argument list.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Oper Name="Kill" Arg="job" Label="bgjob"/>
<Returns>nothing</Returns>
<Description>
This kills the background job represented by the object <A>job</A>
with immediate effect. No more results can be expected from it.
Note that unless one has created the background job with the
<C>TerminateImmediately</C> option set to <K>true</K> one always
has to call <Ref Oper="Kill" Label="bgjob"/> on a background job eventually
for cleanup purposes. Otherwise, the background job and the connecting
pipes remain alive until the parent &GAP; process terminates.

<Section>
<Heading>Parallel programming skeletons</Heading>

In this section we document the operations for the available
skeletons. For a general description of these ideas see other
sources. 

<ManSection>
<Oper Name="ParTakeFirstResultByFork" Arg="jobs, args [,opt]"/>
<Returns>a list of results or <K>fail</K></Returns>
<Description>
The argument <A>jobs</A> must be a list of &GAP; functions and the
argument <A>args</A> a list of the same length containing argument
lists with which the job functions can be called. This operation
starts up a background job using <C>fork</C> for each of the functions
in <A>jobs</A>, calls it with the corresponding argument list in
<A>args</A>. As soon as any of the background jobs finishes with a result,
<Ref Oper="ParTakeFirstResultByFork"/> terminates all other jobs and
reports the results found so far. Note that it can happen that two
jobs finish <Q>at the same time</Q> in the sense that both results 
are received before all other jobs could be terminated. Therefore
the result of <Ref Oper="ParTakeFirstResultByFork"/> is a list, in which
position <M>i</M> is bound if and only if job number <M>i</M> returned
a result. So in the result at least one entry is bound but it is possible
that more than one entry is bound.
<P/>
You can specify an overall timeout to give up the whole computation
if no job finishes by setting the <C>TimeOut</C> component of the
options record <A>opt</A>. In this case you have to set it to
a record with two components <C>tv_sec</C> and <C>tv_usec</C> which
are seconds and microseconds respectively, exactly as returned by the
<Ref Func="IO_gettimeofday"/> function. In the case of timeout 
an empty list is returned.

<Oper Name="ParDoByFork" Arg="jobs, args [,opt]"/>
<Returns>a list of results or <K>fail</K></Returns>
<Description>
The argument <A>jobs</A> must be a list of &GAP; functions and the
argument <A>args</A> a list of the same length containing argument
lists with which the job functions can be called. This operation
starts up a background job using <C>fork</C> for each of the functions
in <A>jobs</A>, calls it with the corresponding argument list in
<A>args</A>. As soon as all of the background jobs finish with a result,
<Ref Oper="ParDoByFork"/> reports the results found. 
Therefore
the result of <Ref Oper="ParDoByFork"/> is a list, in which
position <M>i</M> is bound to the result that job number <M>i</M> returned.
<P/>
You can specify an overall timeout to stop the whole computation
if not all jobs finish in time by setting the <C>TimeOut</C> component of the
options record <A>opt</A>. In this case you have to set it to
a record with two components <C>tv_sec</C> and <C>tv_usec</C> which
are seconds and microseconds respectively, exactly as returned by the
<Ref Func="IO_gettimeofday"/> function. In the case of timeout 
a list is returned in which the positions corresponding to those
jobs that have already finished are bound to the respective results
and the other positions are unbound.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Oper Name="ParListByFork" Arg="l, worker [,opt]"/>
<Returns>a list of results or <K>fail</K></Returns>
<Description>
This is a parallel version of the <Ref Func="List" BookName="ref"/>
function. It applies the function <A>worker</A> to all elements of 
the list <A>l</A> and returns a list containing the results in
corresponding positions. You have to specify the component
<C>NumberJobs</C> in the options record <A>opt</A> which indicates how many
background processes to start. You can optionally use the <C>TimeOut</C>
option exactly as for <Ref Oper="ParDoByFork"/>, however, if a timeout
occurs, <Ref Oper="ParListByFork"/> returns <K>fail</K>.
<P/>
Note that the usefulness of this operation is relatively limited, since
every individual result has to be sent back over a pipe from the child process
to the parent process. Therefore this only makes sense if the computation
time for the worker function dominates the communication time.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Oper Name="ParMapReduceByFork" Arg="l, map, reduce [,opt]"/>
<Returns>a value or <K>fail</K></Returns>
<Description>
This is a parallel version implementation of the classical <C>MapReduce</C>
pattern.
It applies the function <A>map</A> to all elements of 
the list <A>l</A> and then reduces the result using the <A>reduce</A> function
which accepts two return values of <A>map</A> and returns one of them.
Thus, the final result is one return value or <K>fail</K> if the startup
of the jobs fails. You have to specify the component
<C>NumberJobs</C> in the options record <A>opt</A> which indicates how many
background processes to start. You can optionally use the <C>TimeOut</C>
option exactly as for <Ref Oper="ParDoByFork"/>, however, if a timeout
occurs, <Ref Oper="ParMapReduceByFork"/> returns <K>fail</K>.
<P/>
Note that this can be very useful because quite often 
the cumulated computation time for all the worker function calls
dominates the communication time for a single result.
</Description>
</ManSection>

Note that the next parallel skeleton is a worker farm which
is described in the following section.
</Section>

<Section>
<Heading>Worker farms</Heading>

The parallel skeleton of a worker farm is basically nothing but
a bunch of background jobs all with the same worker function and
all eagerly waiting for work. The only additional concepts needed
are an input and an output queue. The input queue contains
argument lists and the output queue pairs of argument lists
and results.

<P/> 
One creates a worker farm with the following operation:
<ManSection>
<Oper Name="ParWorkerFarmByFork" Arg="fun, opt"/>
<Returns>an object representing the worker farm or <K>fail</K></Returns>
<Description>
This operation creates a worker farm with the worker function
<A>fun</A> and sets up its input and output queue. An object representing
the farm is returned unless not all jobs could be started up in which
case <K>fail</K> is returned. After startup all background jobs in the
farm are idle. The only valid option in the options record <A>opt</A>
is <C>NumberJobs</C> and it must be bound to the number of worker
jobs in the farm, a positive integer.
</Description>
</ManSection>

The following operations are for worker farm objects:

<ManSection>
<Oper Name="DoQueues" Arg="wf, block"/>
<Returns> nothing </Returns>
<Description>
This operation called on a worker farm object <A>wf</A> administrates
the input and output queues of the worker farm. In particular it
checks whether new results are available from the workers and if so
it appends them to the output queue. If jobs are idle and the input
queue is non-empty, argument lists from the input queue are sent
to the idle jobs and removed from the input queue.
<P/>
This operation must be called regularly to keep up the communication
with the clients. It uses <C>select</C> and so does not
block if the boolean argument <A>block</A> is set to <K>false</K>. 
However, if larger chunks of data has to be sent or received this
operation might need some time to return.
<P/>
If the boolean argument <A>block</A> is set to true then the 
<Ref Oper="DoQueues"/> blocks until at least one job has returned
a result. This can be used to wait for the termination of all tasks
without burning CPU cycles in the parent job. One would repeatedly
call <Ref Oper="DoQueues"/> with <A>block</A> set to <K>true</K>
and after each such call check with <Ref Oper="IsIdle" Label="wfarm"/>
whether all tasks are done. Note that one should no longer call
<Ref Oper="DoQueues"/> with <A>block</A> set to <K>true</K> once
this is the case since then it would block forever.
<P/>
This operation is called automatically by most of the following
operations.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Oper Name="Kill" Arg="wf" Label="wfarm"/>
<Returns> nothing </Returns>
<Description>
This operation terminates all background jobs in the farm <A>wf</A>, 
which cannot be used subsequently. One should always call this operation
when the worker farm is no longer needed to free resources.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Oper Name="IsIdle" Arg="wf" Label="wfarm"/>
<Returns> <K>true</K> or <K>false</K> </Returns>
<Description>
This operation returns <K>true</K> if all background jobs in the
worker farm <A>wf</A> are idle. This means, that all tasks which
have previously been submitted using <Ref Oper="Submit" Label="wfarm"/> have
been completed and their result been appended to the output
queue. The operation <Ref Oper="DoQueues"/> is automatically
called before the execution of <Ref Oper="IsIdle" Label="wfarm"/>.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Oper Name="Submit" Arg="wg, arglist" Label="wfarm"/>
<Returns> nothing </Returns>
<Description>
This operation submits a task in the form of an argument list for the
worker function to the worker farm. It is appended at the end of the
input queue.
The operation <Ref Oper="DoQueues"/> is automatically
called after the execution of <Ref Oper="Submit" Label="wfarm"/>, giving the
farm a chance to actually send the work out to the worker background
jobs.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Oper Name="Pickup" Arg="wg, arglist" Label="wfarm"/>
<Returns> nothing </Returns>
<Description>
This operation collects all results from the output queue of the
worker farm. The output queue is empty after this function returns.
The results are reported as a list of pairs, each pair has the
input argument list as first component and the output object
as second component.
<P/>
The operation <Ref Oper="DoQueues"/> is automatically
called before the execution of <Ref Oper="Pickup" Label="wfarm"/>, giving the
farm a chance to actually receive some more results from the worker background
jobs.

<Chapter>
    <Heading>I/O multiplexing</Heading>

    <Section>
        <Heading>Introduction</Heading>

Whenever one needs to do input/output on more than one connection (file
descriptor) at a time, some code is needed to organise the I/O
multiplexing. Due to the single-threaded nature of the current &GAP;
language one has to use <Ref Func="IO_select"/> and some
buffering and queueing to organise this. This chapter describes a
relative generic implementation of I/O-multiplexing using so-called
<Ref Oper="IOHub"/> objects. The basic idea is that an <Ref
    Oper="IOHub"/> object handles lots of I/O connections at the same
time and maintains a buffer for each of them. There is a very simple
protocol that marks chunks of data (called <Q>messages</Q>) and whenever
a message has been received completely it is collected in the input
queue of the <Ref Oper="IOHub"/>, marked with the number of the
connection it came from. Rather than sending a message away
in one go, one would always schedule it for sending by appending it to
the output queue. The operation <Ref Oper="DoIO"/>, when called often
enough, will then make sure that the message is sent away eventually.

</Section>

<Section>
    <Heading>The operations for <C>IOHub</C> objects</Heading>

In this section, we simply describe the functions and operations
to create, use and destroy <Ref Oper="IOHub"/> objects.
<ManSection>
<Oper Name="IOHub" Arg=""/>
<Returns> an <Ref Oper="IOHub"/> object </Returns>
<Description>
    This creates a new <Ref Oper="IOHub"/> object at first without any open
    connections.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Oper Name="NewConnection" Arg="h, i, o"/>
<Returns> a positive integer </Returns>
<Description>
    This operation adds a new connection to the <Ref Oper="IOHub"/> object
<A>h</A>. The arguments <A>i</A> and <A>o</A> must be Unix file
descriptors or <M>0</M> and <A>i</A> must be open for reading if
it is positive and <A>o</A> must be open for writing if it is
positive. It is allowed that both file descriptors are equal, but they
may not both be equal to <M>0</M>. The operation returns a positive
integer which is the number under which this new connection will be
administrated in the <Ref Oper="IOHub"/> object. Note that this number is
specific to the object <A>h</A>. <P/>
From the moment these file descriptors are registered with the
<Ref Oper="IOHub"/> object, every subsequent call to <Ref Oper="DoIO"/> will
try to do input and output on them. This means in particular that the
other side of this connection should be in the same initial
state of the protocol. Usually this will be achieved by them being
added as a new connection to a corresponding <Ref Oper="IOHub"/> object on
the other side at the same time. <P/> 
See also <Ref Oper="NewTCPConnection"/> below.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Oper Name="CloseConnection" Arg="h, nr"/>
<Returns> nothing </Returns>
<Description>
    The argument <A>h</A> must be an <Ref Oper="IOHub"/> object and
    <A>nr</A> the number of a connection which was previously returned
    by <Ref Oper="NewConnection"/>. The corresponding connection is
    closed and removed from the <Ref Oper="IOHub"/>.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Oper Name="AttachServingSocket" Arg="h, addr, port"/>
<Returns> a Unix file descriptor or <K>fail</K> </Returns>
<Description>
The argument <A>h</A> must be an <Ref Oper="IOHub"/> object,
<A>addr</A> an IP address or host name as a string and <A>port</A> a
port number (see also <Ref Func="IO_MakeIPAddressPort"/>). 
This operation creates a new socket, binds it to the IP
address
and port and attaches it to the <Ref Oper="IOHub"/> object. From
this moment on the operation <Ref Oper="DoIO"/> will accept new
bidirectional TCP/IP connections on that socket and add them to 
<A>h</A>. The operation returns either the file descriptor of the
new socket or <K>fail</K> if an error occurred.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Oper Name="ShutdownServingSocket" Arg="h"/>
<Returns> nothing </Returns>
<Description>
The argument <A>h</A> must be an <Ref Oper="IOHub"/> object.
Any server socket which was attached to <A>h</A> is shut down,
so no new connections will be accepted.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Oper Name="Shutdown" Arg="h"/>
<Returns> nothing </Returns>
<Description>
The argument <A>h</A> must be an <Ref Oper="IOHub"/> object.
All connections of <A>h</A> will be closed using <Ref
    Oper="CloseConnection"/> and any serving socket will be
shut down using <Ref Oper="ShutdownServingSocket"/>. The <Ref
    Oper="IOHub"/> object will not be usable any more after this call.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Oper Name="AcceptNewConnection" Arg="h"/>
<Returns> a positive integer or <K>fail</K></Returns>
<Description>
The argument <A>h</A> must be an <Ref Oper="IOHub"/> object.
The object <A>h</A> must have a serving socket attached to it
via <Ref Oper="AttachServingSocket"/>, otherwise <K>fail</K> is
returned and nothing happens. One more connection is accepted through
the serving socket. It is added as a new bidirectional TCP/IP
connection to the <Ref Oper="IOHub"/> object and the new connection
number is returned. Note first that this operation blocks until a new
connection comes in. Note furthermore that this operation is  usually
called automatically in <Ref Oper="DoIO"/> whenever a new connection
has come in, which is reported in the internal <Ref Func="IO_select"/>
call. So usually, the client code does not have to call this operation
at all.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Oper Name="SubmitOutput" Arg="h, nr, st"/>
<Returns> <K>true</K> or <K>fail</K> </Returns>
<Description>
    The argument <A>h</A> must be an <Ref Oper="IOHub"/> object,
    <A>nr</A> must be a positive integer which is the number of
    an open connection of <A>h</A> which can be used for output.
    The argument <A>st</A> must be a &GAP; string. This operation
    appends the message <A>st</A> to the end of the output queue
    for the connection <A>nr</A>. Note that at this stage no output
    is actually performed automatically. One has to call
    <Ref Oper="DoIO"/> subsequently to actually send the message away.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Oper Name="GetInput" Arg="h, nr"/>
<Returns> a list of length <M>2</M> </Returns>
<Description>
The argument <A>h</A> must be an <Ref Oper="IOHub"/> object,
<A>nr</A> must be an integer.
If <A>nr</A> is positive, this operation returns the earliest message
which has come in from connection number <A>nr</A> and has not yet been
returned by <Ref Oper="GetInput"/> before. This message is then removed 
from the input queue. If there is no such message, then <K>false</K>
is returned. A message is returned as a plain list of length <M>2</M>
where the first entry is the connection number it came from and
the second entry is a string containing the message itself. If
<A>nr</A> is equal to <M>0</M> then the first message in the input
queue from any connection is returned or <K>false</K> if there is no
message in the input queue.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Oper Name="NewTCPConnection" Arg="h, addr, port"/>
<Returns> a connection number or <K>fail</K> </Returns>
<Description>
The argument <A>h</A> must be an <Ref Oper="IOHub"/> object,
the arguments <A>addr</A> and <A>port</A> must be an address/port
pair as used in <Ref Func="IO_MakeIPAddressPort"/>, so <A>address</A>
can either be a host name or an IP address and <A>port</A> is a port
number. This operation opens a new TCP connection to the address and
port specified, adds a new bidirectional connection to the <Ref Oper="IOHub"/>
<A>h</A> using <Ref Oper="NewConnection"/> 
and returns the connection number specific to the object
<A>h</A>. If anything goes wrong, <K>fail</K> is returned.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Oper Name="OutputQueue" Arg="h"/>
<Returns> a list </Returns>
<Description>
The argument <A>h</A> must be an <Ref Oper="IOHub"/> object.
This returns the internal object for the output queue. Its elements
are pairs where the first entry is the connection number where it
is going to be sent and the second entry is the message as a string.
Only modify this list if you really know what you are doing.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Oper Name="InputQueue" Arg="h"/>
<Returns> a list </Returns>
<Description>
The argument <A>h</A> must be an <Ref Oper="IOHub"/> object.
This returns the internal object for the input queue. Its elements
are pairs where the first entry is the connection number from where
the message was received and the second entry is the message as a string.
Only modify this list if you really know what you are doing.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Oper Name="DoIO" Arg="h [,block]"/>
<Returns> <K>true</K> or <K>false</K> or <K>fail</K> </Returns>
<Description>
The argument <A>h</A> must be an <Ref Oper="IOHub"/> object,
and the optional second argument <A>block</A> must be <K>true</K> or
<K>false</K>. This operation uses <Ref Func="IO_select"/> to decide
which of the file descriptors belonging to the connections of <A>h</A>
are ready to read or write. All file descriptors which are ready are
served, possibly updating the input and output queues. A possible
serving socket is also served accepting a new connection if there is one.
The operation <Ref Oper="DoIO"/> loops until no more file
descriptors are ready. It returns <K>true</K> if some I/O was
performed and <K>false</K> if not. It returns <K>fail</K> if the
<Ref Oper="IOHub"/> is already shut down.
The second argument <A>block</A> indicates
whether or not <Ref Oper="DoIO"/> should block until some I/O
has taken place. If this argument is omitted then <K>false</K>
(non-blocking operation) is the default.<P/>
Note that broken connections are silently closed.

    <Heading> Examples </Heading>

There is an example hash server in the file
<F>examples/hashserver.g</F>.

</Section>

</Chapter>

<Chapter>
<Heading>Examples of usage</Heading>

For larger examples see the <F>example</F> directory of the package. 
You find there a small server using the TCP/IP protocol and
a corresponding client and another small server using the UDP protocol
and a corresponding client. <P/>

Further, there is an example for the
usage of <C>File</C> objects, that read from or write to strings.<P/>

Another example there shows starting up a child process and piping
a few megabytes through it using <Ref Func="IO_Popen2"/>.

<P/>
In the following, we present a few explicit, interactive short examples 
for the usage of the functions in this package. Note that you have to
load the <Package>IO</Package> package with the command 
<C>LoadPackage("IO");</C>
before trying these examples.

<Section>
<Heading>Writing and reading a file</Heading>

The following sequence of commands opens a file with name <F>guck</F> and
writes some things to it:

<Log>
gap> f := IO_File("guck","w");
&lt;file fd=3 wbufsize=65536 wdata=0>
gap> IO_Write(f,"Hello world\n");
12
gap> IO_WriteLine(f,"Hello world2!");
14
gap> IO_Write(f,12345);
5
gap> IO_Flush(f);
true
gap> IO_Close(f);
true
</Log>

There is nothing special about this, the numbers are numbers of bytes
written. Note that only after the <Ref Func="IO_Flush"/> command the
data is actually written to disk. Before that, it resides in the
write buffer of the file. Note further, that the <Ref Func="IO_Flush"/>
call here would not have been necessary, since the <Ref Func="IO_Close"/>
call flushes the buffer anyway.<P/>

The file can again be read with the following sequence of commands:

<Log>
gap> f := IO_File("guck","r");
&lt;file fd=3 rbufsize=65536 rpos=1 rdata=0>
gap> IO_Read(f,10);
"Hello worl"
gap> IO_ReadLine(f);
"d\n"
gap> IO_ReadLine(f);
"Hello world2!\n"
gap> IO_ReadLine(f);
"12345"
gap> IO_ReadLine(f);
""
gap> IO_Close(f);
true
</Log>

Note here that reading line-wise can only be done efficiently by using
buffered I/O. You can mix calls to <Ref Func="IO_Read"/> and to
<Ref Func="IO_ReadLine"/>. The end of file is indicated by an empty
string returned by one of the read functions.
</Section>

<Section>
<Heading>Using filtering programs to read and write files</Heading>

If you want to write a big amount of data to file you might want to compress
it on the fly without using much disk space. This can be achieved with
the following command:

<Log>
gap> s := "";; for i in [1..10000] do Append(s,String(i)); od;;
gap> Length(s);
38894
gap> IO_FileFilterString("guck.gz",[["gzip",["-9c"]]],s);
true
gap> sgz := StringFile("guck.gz");;
gap> Length(sgz);
18541
gap> ss := IO_StringFilterFile([["gzip",["-dc"]]],"guck.gz");;
gap> s=ss;
true
</Log>

This sequence of commands needs that the program <F>gzip</F> is installed
on your system.
</Section>

<Section>
<Heading>Using filters when reading or writing files sequentially</Heading>

If you want to process bigger amounts of data you might not want to
store all of it in a single &GAP; string. In that case you might want
to access a file on disk sequentially through a filter:

<Log>
gap> f := IO_FilteredFile([["gzip",["-9c"]]],"guck.gz","w");
&lt;file fd=5 wbufsize=65536 wdata=0>
gap> IO_Write(f,"Hello world!\n");
13
gap> IO_Write(f,Elements(SymmetricGroup(5)),"\n");
1359
gap> IO_Close(f);
true
gap> f := IO_FilteredFile([["gzip",["-dc"]]],"guck.gz","r");
&lt;file fd=4 rbufsize=65536 rpos=1 rdata=0>
gap> IO_ReadLine(f);
"Hello world!\n"
gap> s := IO_ReadLine(f);; Length(s);
1359
gap> IO_Read(f,10);                  
""
gap> IO_Close(f);
true
</Log>
</Section>

<Section>
<Heading>Accessing a web page</Heading>

The <Package>IO</Package> package has an HTTP client implementation. Using this
you can access web pages and other web downloads from within &GAP;. Here
is an example:

<Log>
gap> r := SingleHTTPRequest("www.math.rwth-aachen.de",80,"GET",
>              "/~Max.Neunhoeffer/index.html",rec(),false,false);;
gap> RecFields(r);
[ "protoversion", "statuscode", "status", "header", "body", "closed" ]
gap> r.status;
"OK"
gap> r.statuscode;
200
gap> r.header;
rec( date := "Thu, 07 Dec 2006 22:08:22 GMT", 
  server := "Apache/2.0.55 (Ubuntu)", 
  last-modified := "Thu, 16 Nov 2006 00:21:44 GMT", 
  etag := "\"2179cf-11a5-3c77f600\"", accept-ranges := "bytes", 
  content-length := "4517", content-type := "text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1" )
gap> Length(r.body);
4517
</Log>

Of course, the time stamps and exact sizes of the answer may differ
when you do this.
</Section>

<Section>
<Heading>(Un-)Pickling</Heading>

Assume you have some &GAP; objects you want to archive to disk grouped
together. Then you might do the following:

<Log>
gap> r := rec( a := 1, b := "Max", c := [1,2,3] );
rec( a := 1, b := "Max", c := [ 1, 2, 3 ] )
gap> r.c[4] := r;
rec( a := 1, b := "Max", c := [ 1, 2, 3, ~ ] )
gap> f := IO_File("guck","w");
&lt;file fd=3 wbufsize=65536 wdata=0>
gap> IO_Pickle(f,r);
IO_OK
gap> IO_Pickle(f,[(1,2,3,4),(3,4)]);
IO_OK
gap> IO_Close(f);
true
</Log>

Then, to read it in again, just do:

<Log>
gap> f := IO_File("guck");
&lt;file fd=3 rbufsize=65536 rpos=1 rdata=0>
gap> IO_Unpickle(f);
rec( a := 1, b := "Max", c := [ 1, 2, 3, ~ ] )
gap> IO_Unpickle(f);
[ (1,2,3,4), (3,4) ]
gap> IO_Unpickle(f);
IO_Nothing
gap> IO_Close(f);
true
</Log>

Note that this works for a certain amount of builtin objects. If you want
to archive your own objects or more sophisticated objects you have to
use extend the functionality as explained in Section 
<Ref Sect="ExtPickFrame"/>. However, it works for lists and records and
they may be arbitrarily self-referential.
