##  PackageInfo.g for the package `IO'                        Max Neunhoeffer
##
##  (created from Frank Lübeck's PackageInfo.g template file)
##  

##  For the LoadPackage mechanism in GAP >= 4.4 only the entries
##  .PackageName, .Version, .PackageDoc, .Dependencies, .AvailabilityTest
##  .Autoload   are needed. The other entries are relevant if the
##  package shall be distributed for other GAP users, in particular if it
##  shall be redistributed via the GAP Website.

##  With a new release of the package at least the entries .Version, .Date and
##  .ArchiveURL must be updated.

SetPackageInfo( rec(

##  This is case sensitive, use your preferred spelling.
#
PackageName := "IO",

##  This may be used by a default banner or on a Web page, should fit on
##  one line.
Subtitle := "Bindings for low level C library IO",

##  See '?Extending: Version Numbers' in GAP help for an explanation
##  of valid version numbers. For an automatic package distribution update
##  you must provide a new version number even after small changes.
Version := "4.1",

##  Release date of the current version in dd/mm/yyyy format.
# 
Date := "30/01/2012",

##  URL of the archive(s) of the current package release, but *without*
##  the format extension(s), like '.zoo', which are given next.
##  The archive file name *must be changed* with each version of the archive
##  (and probably somehow contain the package name and version).
##  The paths of the files in the archive must begin with the name of the
##  directory containing the package (in our "example" probably:
##  example/init.g, ...    or  example-1.3/init.g, ...  )
# 
ArchiveURL := 
     "http://www-groups.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~neunhoef/Computer/Software/Gap/iofor4.5/io-4.1_for4.5",

##  All provided formats as list of file extensions, separated by white
##  space or commas.
##  Currently recognized formats are:
##      .zoo       the (GAP-traditional) zoo-format with "!TEXT!" comments 
##                 for text files
##      .tar.gz    the UNIX standard
##      .tar.bz2   compressed with 'bzip2', often smaller than with gzip
##      -win.zip   zip-format for DOS/Windows, text files must have DOS 
##                 style line breaks (CRLF)
##  
##  In the future we may also provide .deb or .rpm formats which allow
##  a convenient installation and upgrading on Linux systems.
##  
ArchiveFormats := ".tar.gz",

##  If not all of the archive formats mentioned above are provided, these 
##  can be produced at the GAP side. Therefore it is necessary to know which
##  files of the package distribution are text files which should be unpacked
##  with operating system specific line breaks. There are the following 
##  possibilities to specify the text files:
##  
##    - specify below a component 'TextFiles' which is a list of names of the 
##      text files, relative to the package root directory (e.g., "lib/bla.g")
##    - specify below a component 'BinaryFiles' as list of names, then all other
##      files are taken as text files.
##    - if no 'TextFiles' or 'BinaryFiles' are given and a .zoo archive is
##      provided, then the files in that archive with a "!TEXT!" comment are
##      taken as text files
##    - otherwise: exactly the files with names matching the regular expression
##      ".*\(\.txt\|\.gi\|\.gd\|\.g\|\.c\|\.h\|\.htm\|\.html\|\.xml\|\.tex\|\.six\|\.bib\|\.tst\|README.*\|INSTALL.*\|Makefile\)"
##      are taken as text files
##  
##  (Remark: Just providing a .tar.gz file will often result in useful
##  archives)
##  
##  These entries are *optional*.
#TextFiles := ["init.g", ......],
BinaryFiles := ["doc/manual.pdf"],


##  Information about authors and maintainers. Specify for each person a 
##  record with the following information:
##  
##     rec(
##     # these are compulsory, characters are interpreted as latin-1, so
##     # German umlauts and other western European special characters are ok:
##     LastName := "Müller",
##     FirstNames := "Fritz Eduard",
##  
##     # At least one of the following two entries must be given and set 
##     # to 'true' (an entry can be left out if value is not 'true'):
##     IsAuthor := true;
##     IsMaintainer := true;
##  
##     # At least one of the following three entries must be given.
##     # - preferably email address and WWW homepage
##     # - postal address not needed if email or WWW address available
##     # - if no contact known, specify postal address as "no address known"
##     Email := "Mueller@no.org",
##     # complete URL, starting with protocol
##     WWWHome := "http://www.no.org/~Mueller",
##     # separate lines by '\n' (*optional*)
##     PostalAddress := "Dr. F. Müller\nNo Org Institute\nNo Place 13\n\
##     12345 Notown\nNocountry"
##     
##     # If you want, add one or both of the following entries (*optional*)
##     Place := "Notown",
##     Institution := "Institute for Nothing"
##     )
##  
Persons := [
  rec( 
    LastName      := "Neunhoeffer",
    FirstNames    := "Max",
    IsAuthor      := true,
    IsMaintainer  := true,
    Email         := "neunhoef@mcs.st-and.ac.uk",
    WWWHome       := "http://www-groups.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~neunhoef/",
    PostalAddress := Concatenation( [
                       "School of Mathematics and Statistics\n",
                       "Mathematical Institute\n",
                       "North Haugh\n",
                       "St Andrews, Fife KY16 9SS\n",
                       "Scotland, UK" ] ),
    Place         := "St Andrews",
    Institution   := "University of St Andrews"
  ),
],

##  Status information. Currently the following cases are recognized:
##    "accepted"      for successfully refereed packages
##    "deposited"     for packages for which the GAP developers agreed 
##                    to distribute them with the core GAP system
##    "dev"           for development versions of packages 
##    "other"         for all other packages
##
# Status := "accepted",
Status := "deposited",

##  You must provide the next two entries if and only if the status is 
##  "accepted" because is was successfully refereed:
# format: 'name (place)'
# CommunicatedBy := "Mike Atkinson (St. Andrews)",
#CommunicatedBy := "",
# format: mm/yyyy
# AcceptDate := "08/1999",
#AcceptDate := "",

##  For a central overview of all packages and a collection of all package
##  archives it is necessary to have two files accessible which should be
##  contained in each package:
##     - A README file, containing a short abstract about the package
##       content and installation instructions.
##     - The PackageInfo.g file you are currently reading or editing!
##  You must specify URLs for these two files, these allow to automate 
##  the updating of package information on the GAP Website, and inclusion
##  and updating of the package in the GAP distribution.
#
README_URL := 
  "http://www-groups.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~neunhoef/Computer/Software/Gap/io/README.io",
PackageInfoURL := 
  "http://www-groups.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~neunhoef/Computer/Software/Gap/iofor4.5/PackageInfo.g",

##  Here you  must provide a short abstract explaining the package content 
##  in HTML format (used on the package overview Web page) and an URL 
##  for a Webpage with more detailed information about the package
##  (not more than a few lines, less is ok):
##  Please, use '<span class="pkgname">GAP</span>' and
##  '<span class="pkgname">MyPKG</span>' for specifing package names.
##  
# AbstractHTML := "This package provides  a collection of functions for \

##  Here is the information on the help books of the package, used for
##  loading into GAP's online help and maybe for an online copy of the 
##  documentation on the GAP website.
##  
##  For the online help the following is needed:
##       - the name of the book (.BookName)
##       - a long title, shown by ?books (.LongTitle, optional)
##       - the path to the manual.six file for this book (.SixFile)
##       - a decision if the book should be (auto)loaded, probably 'true'
##         (.Autoload)
##  
##  For an online version on a Web page further entries are needed, 
##  if possible, provide an HTML- and a PDF-version:
##      - if there is an HTML-version the path to the start file,
##        relative to the package home directory (.HTMLStart)
##      - if there is a PDF-version the path to the .pdf-file,
##        relative to the package home directory (.PDFFile)
##      - give the paths to the files inside your package directory
##        which are needed for the online manual (either as URL .Archive
##        if you pack them into a separate archive, or as list 
##        .ArchiveURLSubset of directory and file names which should be 
##        copied from your package archive, given in .ArchiveURL above
##  
##  For links to other GAP or package manuals you can assume a relative 
##  position of the files as in a standard GAP installation.
##  
# in case of several help books give a list of such records here:
PackageDoc := rec(
  # use same as in GAP

  PDFFile   := "doc/manual.pdf",
  # the path to the .six file used by GAP's help system
  SixFile   := "doc/manual.six",
  # a longer title of the book, this together with the book name should
  # fit on a single text line (appears with the '?books' command in GAP)
  # LongTitle := "Elementary Divisors of Integer Matrices",
  LongTitle := "Bindings to low level I/O in the C library",
  # Should this help book be autoloaded when GAP starts up? This should
  # usually be 'true', otherwise say 'false'.

##  Provide a test function for the availability of this package.
##  For packages which will not fully work, use 'Info(InfoWarning, 1,
##  ".....")' statements. For packages containing nothing but GAP code,
##  just say 'ReturnTrue' here.
##  With the new package loading mechanism (GAP >=4.4)  the availability
##  tests of other packages, as given under .Dependencies above, will be 
##  done automatically and need not be included in this function.
#AvailabilityTest := ReturnTrue,
AvailabilityTest := function()
