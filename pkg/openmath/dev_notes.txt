Development notes file, by Marco Costantini with updated by Alexander Konovalov

This file contains notes for development and for releasing a new version; 
it is not intended to be a part of the release.

######################################################################

MAKING A CHANGE:

* test the package functionality:

ReadTest( Filename( DirectoriesPackageLibrary( "openmath", "tst" ), "test_new" ) );

* update the local gap dev version:
cd /usr/local/gap_dev/4.0/
make
cd
gap_dev -A -N
CreateCompletionFiles();

* test the package functionality:

ReadTest( Filename( DirectoriesPackageLibrary( "openmath", "tst" ), "test_new" ) );

* do the changes.

* if a new file is added, add lines like
Revision.("openmath/dev_notes.txt") :=
    "@(#)$Id: dev_notes.txt,v 1.44 2009/05/26 16:42:07 alexk Exp $"; see
also the file structure at
/usr/local/gap_dev/4.0/doc/htm/ext/CHAP003.htm#SECT002

* check that new features or bug fixes are included in the test file, 
and, if test file is modified, test the package functionality.

cd /usr/local/gap_dev/4.0/pkg/openmath/tst
nano test_new.src

mv test_new test_new.bak
gap_dev -T -A -b < test_new.src
nano +30000 test_new

diff test_new test_new.bak

rm test_new.bak
gap_dev
ReadTest( Filename( DirectoriesPackageLibrary( "openmath", "tst" ), "test_new" ) );

* check that the README files and the manual contain the changes.

* test that the manual still compiles, and that the content is OK:

cd /usr/local/gap_dev/4.0/pkg/openmath/doc
./make_doc
xpdf manual.pdf &

* commit the various changes to the CVS repository.



PREPARING A NEW RELEASE:

* check the functionality, also with gpipe method, and with an older
version of Gap.

* modify date and version number in file PackageInfo.g and version 
number in files doc/manual.xml, doc/openmath.xml and init.g

* test the PackageInfo.g, and that the documentation is available in Gap:

ValidatePackageInfo( Filename( DirectoriesPackageLibrary( "openmath", "" ), "PackageInfo.g" ) );
?OMPrint

* commit PackageInfo.g and doc/manual.xml

* copy the package directory to some place to create the tarball

* remove "phantom" directories:

rm -rf OMlib bin protos

* remove the various *.bak, *~ and files from compilation doing make clean in both
locations, otherwise get a fresh copy from CVS repository

* remove dev_notes.txt and Makefile from the package's root directory

* remove possibly hidden files left e.g. '.DS_Store' left by Mac OS

* do chmod -x:
cd /usr/local/gap_dev/4.0/pkg/openmath
chmod -x tst/test5.omt

* compile the documentation:

ReadPackage("openmath/gap/buildman.g");
OPENMATHBuildManual();

* remove CVS subdirectories:
rm -r CVS/ */CVS/ */*/CVS/

* prepare the archive, with the right version number:
cd ..
tar cfvz openmath-06.01.03.tar.gz openmath/

* note the archive size:
ls -l openmath-*.tar.gz

* copy archive, PackageInfo.g, README to web page:
scp openmath-*.tar.gz openmath/PackageInfo.g openmath/README gate.science.unitn.it:

scp openmath-*.tar.gz PackageInfo.g README  degiorgi:public_html/gap_code/openmath/
rm openmath-*.tar.gz PackageInfo.g README

* check the PackageInfo.g online:

konqueror http://www.gap-system.org/Packages/Authors/authors.html &
http://www-math.science.unitn.it/~costanti/gap_code/openmath/PackageInfo.g

* update the web-page: modify version, link and size:
pico public_html/index.html

* get a fresh copy of CVS repository, with CVS directories.

* recompile, reconfigure, etc... :

cd openmath

cd doc
./make_doc
cd ..

cd OMCv1.3c/src/
./configure
make
cd ../../
./configure ../../
make

chmod -x tst/test5.omt

* test again:

?OMTest
ReadTest( Filename( DirectoriesPackageLibrary( "openmath", "tst" ), "test_new" ) );

* Send a mail about the new release to the GAP Support to include it in the
  next update of the packages archive

* check that the new version is uploaded on the Gap site.

* advertise the new version

ENCODING AND CONVERSIONS:

OpenMath objects can be encoded into various formats:

XML	(as defined by OpenMath standard)
binary	(as defined by OpenMath standard)
gpipe	(defined as the output of the program 'gpipe', included in the package)


Conversion from OpenMath to Gap:

* 'OMgetObjectByteStream' takes a stream in gpipe encoding and returns a
Gap object. 

* 'gpipe' takes a file in XML or binary encoding, autodetects, and
produces a gpipe encoded file. 

* 'OMpipeObject' takes a string in XML or binary encoding, pipes it to
'gpipe', and calls 'OMgetObjectByteStream'.

* 'OMgetObjectXMLTree' converts the OpenMath XML into a tree (using the
function ParseTreeXMLString from package GapDoc) and parses it.

* 'OMGetObject' takes a stream in XML or binary encoding, pipes it to
'gpipe', and calls either OMpipeObject or OMgetObjectXMLTree.


Conversion from Gap to OpenMath:

OMPutObject takes a Gap object and puts into a stream, with XML
encoding.

This package includes the external program 'tpipe' (OMCv1.3c/src/tpipe)
that converts an OpenMath object with unknown/binary/XML encoding to
binary or XML encoding, and 'gpipe' (bin/*/gpipe), that converts an
OpenMath object with unknown/binary/XML encoding to gpipe.




######################################################################


VALIDATING XML:


The following function can be used to validate the OpenMath XML objects
produced by the package. It requires the program 'xmllint', from
Libxml2, the XML C library for Gnome, available from
http://www.xmlsoft.org/ and included in most modern Linux distributions. 


OMValidate := function ( obj )

    local  file, fromgap_stream, togap_stream, togap, xmllint_exec, openmath2_rng, OMPutObject;

    OMPutObject := function ( stream, x )
          OMIndent := 0;
          OMWriteLine( stream, [ "<OMOBJ xmlns=\"http://www.openmath.org/OpenMath\">" ] );
          OMIndent := OMIndent + 1;
          OMPut( stream, x );
          OMIndent := OMIndent - 1;
          OMWriteLine( stream, [ "</OMOBJ>" ] );
          return;
      end;

    file := Filename( OMDirectoryTemporary, "testfile" );
    fromgap_stream := OutputTextFile( file, false );
    SetPrintFormattingStatus( fromgap_stream, false );
    OMPutObject( fromgap_stream, obj );
    CloseStream( fromgap_stream );

    xmllint_exec := Filename( DirectoriesSystemPrograms(  ), "xmllint" );
    openmath2_rng := Filename( DirectoriesPackageLibrary( "openmath", "tst" ), "openmath2.rng" );

    togap := "";
    togap_stream := OutputTextString( togap, false );
    SetPrintFormattingStatus( togap_stream, false );
    Process( OMDirectoryTemporary, xmllint_exec, InputTextNone(), togap_stream,
     [ "--noout", "--relaxng", openmath2_rng, "testfile" ] );
    CloseStream( togap_stream );

    if togap <> "testfile validates\n" and togap <> "testfile fails to validate\n"  then
        Print( togap );
    fi;

    return togap = "testfile validates\n";
end;


The XML produced by this package can be partially validated with http://validator.w3.org

Just prepend the following line to a file generated by this package,

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>

and one of the following, for OpenMath version 2.0, 1.1, 1.0 respectively.

<!DOCTYPE OMOBJ SYSTEM "http://www.openmath.org/standard/om20-2004-06-30/openmath2.dtd">
<!DOCTYPE OMOBJ SYSTEM "http://www.openmath.org/standard/om11/omobj.dtd">
<!DOCTYPE OMOBJ SYSTEM "http://www.openmath.org/standard/relaxng/openmath1.dtd">



######################################################################

KNOWN PROBLEMS:
These problems are from the original code by Andrew Solomon.

* A set doesn't store to be a set, hence the method ``OMPut: for a set''
is used only for the empty set. 

IsSet([ 1, true, false ]);
OMPrint([ 1, true, false ]);
OMPrint([  ]);


* Conversion of CharacterTable doesn't work.

OMTest(CharacterTable( AlternatingGroup( [ 1 .. 3 ] ) ));


* Consecutive comments <!-- ... --> or encodings <? ... ?> inside an
input stream are not supported.

stream := InputTextUser(); g := OMGetObject(stream);CloseStream(stream);

<!-- ... -->
<? .

* OMPut: for a Hasse diagram creates OpenMath variables like <OMV name="1"/>
which are invalid OpenMath variables names.

* Having different compiled versions of the OMCv1.3c library for
different architectures is not supported.

######################################################################

TODO:


* Include experimental, or updated CDs
http://www.openmath.org/cdnames.html

- For converting Gap -> OpenMath, add a method for 'OMPut', in file
gap/omput.gi .

- For converting OpenMath -> Gap, add in 'OMsymTable_new', in file
gap/new.g .

- For converting a nullary symbol OpenMath -> Gap, add code in
'OMnullarySymbolToGAP', in file gap/gap.g . (Remark: OMnullarySymbolToGAP
removed by AK in April 2009, now all is done by OMsymLookup function).

- For a conversion in Yacas, use there OMDef(yacasSymbol, cd, name)


######################################################################

TODO:


* Convert OMsymTable and related stuff from list to record
(Remark: done by AK in April 2009 with renaming to OMsymRecord).

* Remove the difference between nullary and n-ary symbols, and use the
OpenMath roles instead, see the OpenMath Standard, version 2.0, section
"2.1.4 OpenMath Symbol Roles". (Remark: OMnullarySymbolToGAP
removed by AK in April 2009, now all is done by OMsymLookup function).


######################################################################

TODO:


* Check the file permissions: in some case -rw-rw-r-- should be replaced
with -rw-r--r-- .


######################################################################

TODO:

* In function OMgapNativeStatementFunc, of gap/gap.g, is it necessary to
use READ_COMMAND (instead e.g. of Read) ?

Is it necessary to use ViewString ? 

Would it be possible to remove ViewString, or to use StringView from the
GapDoc package, and to remove the file gap/printutil.g? 

The only purpose of gap/printutil.g is to provide ViewString to
OMgapNativeStatementFunc. 

Is Gap is started with -A, openmath is loaded, and thereafter GapDoc is
loaded, then an error occurs, because IsObjToBePrinted is defined in
both.


######################################################################

TODO:

Check the functions OMnextToken and OMinstreamNextByte: they do the same.

Some IsHasseDiagram stuff is already defined in main Gap library
lib/relation.gd:

#P  IsHasseDiagram(<rel>)
##
##  returns `true' if the binary relation <rel>  is  a  Hasse  Diagram  of  a
##  partial  order,  i.e.  was  computed   via   `HasseDiagramBinaryRelation'
##  (see~"HasseDiagramBinaryRelation").
##
DeclareProperty("IsHasseDiagram", IsBinaryRelation);

Something from hasse/hasse.g could be removed.



######################################################################


TODO:

Maybe the top-level makefile can be changed, in order to automatically
compile the OMCv1.3c library. Maybe not, in order to point that the Gap
code and the OMCv1.3c library are two different products.


TODO:

* update OMCv1.3c library

---> The library is available from:
ftp://ftp-sop.inria.fr/safir/OM

The package contains the OMCv1.3c library, it could be updated to
OMCv1.4a. It is available also at
http://www.openmath.org/software/OMCv1.4a.tgz

There is file with a wrong name: this is fixed with (compare also with
OMCv1.3c):

cd OMCv1.4a/src
mv test1.omx test1.omt


After compiling, I get 

--- doing some auto-tests for OpenMath lib libOM.a ...

auto testing general IO...
ok: test pipe1
ok: test pipe2
failed: test pipe3 (please check file BUGREP)

auto testing automatic encoding detection...
failed: test binary encoding auto detect (please check file BUGREP)
ok: test XML encoding auto detect

Hence it is not clear to me whether it works correctly or not.

Dear Olivier Arsac and Stéphane Dalmas,
I have downloaded the file "OpenMath INRIA C library" 
http://www.openmath.org/cocoon/openmath/software/OMCv1.4a.tgz

Is there a newer version, or is the latest version available at 
http://www.openmath.org/cocoon/openmath/software/ ?

In src directory there is a file test1.omx , but the test in Makefile requires 
test1.omt .


However, the test fails: I get (on a Linux 2.4.21-0.13mdk i686 machine)

--- doing some auto-tests for OpenMath lib libOM.a ...

auto testing general IO...
ok: test pipe1
ok: test pipe2
failed: test pipe3 (please check file BUGREP)

auto testing automatic encoding detection...
failed: test binary encoding auto detect (please check file BUGREP)
ok: test XML encoding auto detect

auto testing encodings...
ok: test enc string XML
ok: test enc string binary
ok: test enc wide char string XML
ok: test enc wide char string binary
ok: test enc array XML
ok: test enc array binary
ok: test enc double XML
ok: test enc double binary

--- auto-tests done.

What can I do to solve/further investigate  this problem? I cannot find any 
"file BUGREP".

Best regards,
Marco Costantini

I'm afraid it is the latest version...  It dates back from a time when 
there was no readily available XML library.

I checked here and it works right (on a Fedora Core 3 Linux 
distribution, first time I tried to compile the library in 3 years...). 
Maybe it is because "test1.omt" is missing ?

The file says that there is no know bug ! and that you should mail us if 
you find one.

I'm no more working on that and thus won't be able to help you a lot...

Descriptions of utilities (copied from their output):

omproxy 
   OpenMath proxy.
   Repeats an incoming stream.
   (stream may be socket or file).
   when going through, OpenMath objects may be traced.

   eg: omproxy -o received.om
   eg: omproxy -i tosend.om -h server.com -p 8000
   eg: omproxy -l 8000 -d routed.om -h server.com -p 8000
   eg: omproxy -i in.om -o out.om -v3

   -l --inport: int (7007)
      port to listen to for connection to proxy.
   -p --outport: int (7007)
      port to use for host connection.
   -h --host: string (res08-obk1.resnet.st-andrews.ac.uk)
      host to connect to.
   -i --infile: string
      file to read from (instead of socket).
   -o --outfile: string
      file to write to (instead of socket).
   -d --dupfile: string
      duplicate output into this file.
   -e --encoding: string (mimic)
      encoding used for output. (mimic, binary or xml)
   --tracefile: string
      file to write log to (default is stdout).
   -v --verbosity: int (0)
      verbosity level (0 nothing, 1 only tokens, 2 tokens+time, 3 2+values).


tenc -[bt] -[swad]
   Test some encode/decode functions,
   in binary or text mode depending on option switch -b or -t).
   -s for string utf7 encoding.
   -w for wide char string utf7 encoding.
   -a for byte arrays encoding.
   -d for portable double encoding.
   Exit status is 0 if test has run smoothly, 1 otherwise.


tpipe -[ubx][bx] inFile outFile
   Pipe OpenMath inFile into OpenMath outFile
   in/outFile may be replaced by - for stdin/out.
   Used mainly for tests or sample purpose
   May also be used as a conversion tool,
   or as a basic pretty printer for XML OpenMath files.
   u/b/x means unknown/binary/xml encoding.
   u: creates an input device that will try to autodetect its encoding type.
   eg: tpipe -bx A B
         Converts binary file A into XML text file B.
         (pretty printing it by the way).
       tpipe -ub A B
         Converts an unknown encoding type OpenMath file A into a binary file B.


gpipe -[ubx] inFile outFile
   Pipe OpenMath inFile into GAP-stream outFile
   in/outFile may be replaced by - for stdin/out.
   Used mainly for tests or sample purpose
   May also be used as a conversion tool,
   or as a basic pretty printer for XML OpenMath files.
   u/b/x means unknown/binary/xml encoding.
   u: creates an input device that will try to autodetect its encoding type.
   eg: tpipe -b A B
         Converts binary file A into GAP input file B.
       tpipe -u A B
         Converts an unknown encoding type OpenMath file A into a GAP input file B.

How to produce binary test files:

1) *.bin is the binary file produced by tpipe, for example:

../OMCv1.3c/src/tpipe -xb test3.omt test3.bin

2) *.out is the output file produced from *.bin by gpipe, for example:

../OMCv1.3c/src/tpipe -xb test4.omt test4.bin
../bin/i686-apple-darwin9.6.0-gcc/gpipe -b test4.bin test4.out
