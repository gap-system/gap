The package provides an OpenMath phrasebook for GAP: it allows GAP users to
import and export mathematical objects encoded in OpenMath, for the purpose 
of exchanging them with other OpenMath-enabled applications. 

The OpenMath package is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify 
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free 
Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any 
later version. See the FSF's own site http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html
for the details.

The installation of the package is standard: for details, see Gap reference
manual, chapter "GAP Packages" (and if you don't have write access to the
Gap installation, type in GAP "?GAP root directory" to see another relevant
part of the manual).
