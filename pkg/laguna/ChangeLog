                    Brief history of the LAGUNA package 

1.0 - 2.0 
    LAG package maintained by Richard Rossmanith. 

2.1 * Obsolete operation `BasisByGeneratorsNC' replaced by `BasisNC'
      (lib/lag.gi)
    * Version changed (init.g)
      - ideally init.g should read VERSION (so it need only be changed in
        one place), but the commented out method to do this needs to be
        verified that it works on Windows and Macintosh
    * Split off ReadPkg of .gi file into read.g
    * Tidied up README.lag
    * Added VERSION, ChangeLog
    * All other changes made were to improve the documentation
      - (non-empty) doc/manual.bib added 
      - doc/Makefile now has targets for manual.ps, manual.pdf, htm
      - Updated examples for GAP 4.3 (doc/lag.msk)
      - Markup changes so that bibliography and HTML version now possible
        (doc/{lag.msk,manual.tex},lib/lag.gd)

    -- Victor Bovdi, Alexander Konovalov, Csaba Schneider, March 2003.

3.1 * Accepted version of the LAGUNA package (June 2003) 
      - improved documentation
      - optimized Augmentation code
      - added IsSymmetric and IsUnitary

3.2 * Fully compatibile with the new package loading mechanism of GAP 4.4
      (July 2003)

3.2.1 * Interface improvements (July 2003):
        - Added InfoLevel 4 and made InfoLevel 1 the default one
        - Mentioned LAGUNA in method's descriptions for better tracing

3.2.2 * Minor updates for coming GAP 4.4 release (April 2004):
        - making sure that Augmentation(x) is in the underlying ring
        - checking whether x=0 in IsUnit(x)
        
3.3 (April 2005)
    * Functions for fast construction of left/right/two-sided group ring
      ideals generated by elements of the form h-1, where h in H\{1} and
      H is a subgroup of the underlying group (contributed by A.Tsapok).
    * Pseudo-Random method for getting random elements from Units(KG) 
      and NormalizedUnitGroup(KG), taking them randomly from KG until we
      get a unit; in normalized case augmentation is adjusted to one.
    * Method for the embedding of the subgroup of an underlying group
      to the normalized unit group given by power-commutator presentation. 
    * Operation PartialAugmentations returning a list of partial 
      augmentations of an element of a group ring and corresponding
      conjugacy classses (contributed by A.Tsapok).
    * New attribute LieDerivedLength for Lie algebras  
    * Computation of bicyclic units and of the bicyclic unit group.
    * Computation of the unitary subgroup of the normalized unit group 
      (immediate method for small groups).
    * Computation of the Lie upper codimension series of a finite 
      p-group  
    * Fixed some bugs:  
      - Replaced 'GeneratorsOfGroup' --> 'MinimalGeneratingSet' in
        DimensionBasis to fix a bug with SmallGroup(512,2).
      - Adjusted LieDerivedSubalgebra for compatibility with the
        Sophus package by Csaba Schneider.
      - Fixed a bug with the nilpotency index of the augmentation
        ideal when p>2 (thanks to Inger Christin Borge for reporting
        this bug!).
      - Fixed a bug with IsUnit and InverseOp for elements of order
        q^n in characteristic p where (p,q)=1.                 
      - Added SetIsPGroup(U,true) for normalized unit groups of
        modular group algebras of finite p-groups for correct
        method selection (for example, for the computation of
        their automorphism groups).

3.3.1 (May 2005)
    * The method for 'LieAlgebraByDomain' was restricted to group
      algebras for better compatibility with the GAP system.
