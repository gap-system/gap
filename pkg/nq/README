Nilpotent quotients
-------------------

The lower  central series G_i of a  group G can be defined inductively
as G_0 = G, G_i = [G_(i-1),G]. G is said to have nilpotency class c if
c is the smallest non-zero integer such that G_c = 1. If N is a normal
subgroup  of G and G/N   is nilpotent, then  N  contains G_i for  some
non-negative integer i. G has infinite nilpotent quotients if and only
if G/G_1  is infinite.  The  i-th (i  > 1)  factor G_(i-1)/G_i of  the
lower central series  is generated by  the elements [g,h]G_i,  where g
runs through a  set of representatives of  G/G_1 and h runs  through a
set of representatives of G_(i-2)/G_(i-1).

Any  finitely generated nilpotent group  is polycyclic and, therefore,
has  a subnormal series with  cyclic factors.  Such a subnormal series
can be used   to  represent  the group  in   terms of   a   polycyclic
presentation.    The ANU NQ  computes  successively  the factor groups
modulo  the terms of the lower  central series.   Each factor group is
represented by a special  form of polycyclic presentation, a nilpotent
presentation, that makes use of the  nilpotent structure of the factor
group.  Chapters  9 and 11 of the  book by C.C.  Sims, "Computing with
finitely presented groups", discusses  polycyclic presentations  and a
nilpotent quotient algorithm.  A description of this implementation is
contained in 

Werner  Nickel  (1996) "Computing    Nilpotent Quotients   of Finitely
Presented    Groups" in  Dimacs  Series  in   Discrete Mathematics and
Theoretical Computer Science, Volume 25, pp 175-191.


About this version
------------------

This directory  contains the Australian National  University Nilpotent
Quotient Program (ANU  NQ), an implementation of  a nilpotent quotient
algorithm  in C.  This implementation  has  been developed  in a  Unix
environment and Unix is currently the only operating system supported.
It runs on a number of  different Unix versions. An earlier version of
the ANU NQ is also available as  part of quotpic (Derek F. Holt, Sarah
Rees: A  graphics system for  displaying finite quotients  of finitely
presented groups.  DIMACS Workshop on Groups  and Computation, AMS-ACM
1991).

This directory contains the following directories and files:

How to install the ANU NQ
-------------------------

The installation of the program is  easy. However, it requires the GNU
multiple precision library (GNU MP).  If this library is not available
on your system, it has to be installed  first. A copy of GNU MP can be
obtained from:

        http://gmplib.org/

You start compiling NQ by running the configure script:

        ./configure

Among other things it will tell you whether it succeeded in locating
the GNU MP library and the corresponding include files. If it tells
you that it could not find the GNU MP include files or the GNU MP
libraries, you have to run configure with additional parameters. For
example, if you have installed GNU MP yourself in your home directory,
you would type something like the following

        ./configure --with-gmp=/home/me/gmp

If configure reports no problems, you proceed by typing

        make

A compiled version of the program named  `nq'  is then placed into the
directory `bin/<complicated name>'.   The <complicated name> component
encodes the operating system and the compiler used.  This allows you
to compile NQ on several architectures sharing the same files system.

If there are  any  warnings or  even  fatal error messages  during the
compilation process, please send  a copy to the address  at the end of
this  document together with  information about your operating system,
the compiler you  used  and any  changes you  might have  made  to the
source code. We will have a look at your problems and try to fix them.
 
After the compilation  is finished you   can  check if the ANU  NQ  is
running properly on your system.  Simply type

    make test

This runs some computations and compares their output with the  output
files in the directory `examples'. If any errors are reported,  please
follow the instruction that are printed out.
 
How to use the ANU NQ
---------------------

If you start the ANU  NQ by typing
     nq -X

you will get the following message:
    unknown option: -X
    usage: nq [-a] [-M] [-d] [-g] [-v] [-s] [-f] [-c] [-m]
              [-t <n>] [-l <n>] [-r <n>] [-n <n>] [-e <n>]
              [-y] [-o] [-p] [-E] [<presentation>] [<class>]

All parameters in    square  brackets are  optional.    The  parameter
<presentation> has to be  the name  of  a file that contains  a finite
group presentation for which a nilpotent quotient is to be calculated.
This file name must not start with a digit.  If  it is not present, nq
will read the presentation from standard input.  The parameter <class>
restricts the computation of the  nilpotent  quotient to at most  that
(nilpotency) class, i.e.  the program calculates the quotient group of
the (c+1)-th term of the lower central series.  If <class> is omitted,
the   program computes successively   the factor  groups  of the lower
central series of the  given group.  If there  is a  largest nilpotent
quotient, i.e.,  if  the  lower central series  becomes  constant, the
program will eventually terminate with the largest nilpotent quotient.
If  there is   no largest  nilpotent  quotient, the  program  will run
forever (or more precisely will run out of resources).  On termination
the program prints a nilpotent presentation for the nilpotent quotient
it has computed.

The options -l, -r and  -e can be used  to enforce Engel conditions on
the nilpotent quotient to be calculated.  All these options have to be
followed by a positive integer <n>. Their meaning is the following:

        -n <k> This option forces the first k generators to be left
               or right Engel element if also the option -l or -r 
               (or both) is present. Otherwise it is ignored.

        -l <n> This forces the first k generators g_1,...,g_k  of the
               nilpotent quotient Q to be left n-Engel elements, i.e.,
               they satisfy [x,...,x,g_i] = 1 (x occurring n-times)
               for all x in Q and 1 <= i <= k. If the option -n is not
               used, then k = 1.

        -r <n> This forces the first k generators g_1,...,g_k  of the
               nilpotent quotient Q to be right n-Engel elements,i.e.,
               they satisfy [g_i,x,..,x] = 1 (x occurring n-times) 
               for all x in Q and 1 <= i <= k. If the option -n is not
               used, then k = 1.

        -e <n> This enforces the n-th Engel law on Q, i.e., [x,y,..,y]
               = 1 (y occurring n-times) for all x,y in Q.

        -t <n> This option specifies how much  CPU time the program is
               allowed to use. It will terminate after  <n> seconds of
               CPU time.  If <n> is followed (without space) by one of
               the letters  m,   h or d,  <n>  specifies the  time  in
               minutes, hours or days, respectively.

The other options  have the following  meaning.  Care has to  be taken
when   the options -s  or -c  are   used since the resulting nilpotent
quotient need NOT satisfy   the required Engel condition. The  reason
for this is that a smaller set of test  words is used  if one of these
two options are present. Although this smaller set of test words seems
to be sufficient to  enforce the required  Engel condition, this  fact
has not been proven.

        -a For  each factor  of the  lower  central series  a  file is
           created in the current  directory that contains an integer
           matrix describing the   factor as abelian group. The  first
           number in that file is the number of columns of the matrix.
           Then the matrix follows in row major  order. The matrix for
           the  i-th    factor      is    put    into     the     file
           <presentation>.abinv.<i>.

        -p toggles printing of the pc  presentation for the  nilpotent
           quotient at the end of a calculation.

        -s This  option  causes the program  to   check only semigroup
           words in the generating set of  the nilpotent quotient when
           an Engel condition is enforced. If none  of the options -l,
           -r or -e are present, it is ignored.

        -f This option causes to check semiwords in the generating set
           of the  nilpotent quotient first  and then  all other words
           that need to be checked. It is  ignored if the option -s is
           used or none of the options -l, -r or -e are present.

        -c This option stops  checking the Engel  law at each class if
           all  the checks   of a certain    weight did not  yield any
           non-trivial instances of the law.

        -d Switch  on  debug mode   and   perform checks   during  the
           computation. Not yet implemented.

        -o In checking Engel identities, instances are process in the
           order of increased weight.  This flag reverses the order.

        -y Enforce the identities x^8  and [ [x1,x2,x3], [x4,x5,x6]  ]
           on the nilpotent quotient.

        -v Switch on verbose mode.

        -g Produce GAP output. Presently the  GAP output consists only
           of a sequence of integer matrices  whose rows are relations
           of  the  factors of  the lower central  series  as  abelian
           groups. This will change as soon as GAP can handle infinite
           polycyclic groups.

        -E the *last* n generators are Engel generators.  This works
           in conjunction with option -n.

        -m output  the  relation matrix for each  factor  of the lower
           central series.  The matrices are written to files with the
           names 'matrix.<cl>' where <cl> is replaced by the number of
           the factor in the lower central series.  Each file contains
           first the number of columns of the matrix and then the rows
           of the  matrix.  The matrix is  written as each relation is
           produced and is not in upper triangular form.

        -M output the relation  matrix before and after relations have
           been enforced.  This results   in two groups of files  with
           names  '<pres>.nilp.<cl>' and  '<pres>.mult.<cl>'     where
           <pres>  is  the name of the   input files  and <cl>  is the
           class.  The matrices are in upper triangular form.

The input format for presentations
----------------------------------

The  input  format for  finite presentations resembles  the  way  many
people write down a presentation on paper.  Here are  some examples of
presentations that the ANU NQ accepts:

    < a, b | >                       # free group of rank 2

    < a, b, c | [a,b,c],             # a left normed commutator
                [b,c,c,c]^6,         # another one raised to a power
                a^2 = c^-3*a^2*c^3,  # a relation
                a^(b*c) = a,         # a conjugate relation
                (a*[b,(a*c)])^6      # something that looks complicated
    >

A presentation starts  with   '<' followed be  a  list   of generators
separated by  commas.  Generator  names are strings  that contain only
upper and lower case letters, digits, dots and underscores and that do
not start with a digit.  The list of generator names is separated from
the   list of relators/relations   by  the symbol  '|'.  Relators  and
relations  are separated  by  commas and  can   be  mixed arbitrarily.
Parentheses can be  used  in order  to  group subexpressions together.
Square brackets can be used in order  to form left normed commutators.
The symbols  '*'  and '^' can be  used  to   form products and powers,
respectively. The  presentation   finishes  with  the  symbol '>'.   A
comment  starts with the symbol  '#' and  finishes at  the  end of the
line.  The file src/presentation.c contains a complete grammar for the
presentations accepted by the ANU NQ.

An example
----------

Let G be  the free group  on two generators  x  and y. The input  file
(called free2.fp here) contains the following:

        < x, y | >

Computing the class 3 quotient with the ANU NQ by typing

        nq free2.fp 3

produces the following output:

Most of the comments are fairly self-explanatory. One  note of caution
is necessary:  The  number of generators for each  factor of the lower
central series is not the minimal number possible but is the number of
generators that the ANU NQ chose to use. This will be  improved in one
of   the future  version of  the  program.  The epimorphism  from  the
original group  onto the nilpotent  quotient  is printed in a somewhat
confusing way.  The generators on  the left  hand  side of the  arrows
correspond to  the  generators  in the original  presentation  but are
printed with different names.  This  will be  fixed in one of the next
version.

Some remarks about the algorithm
--------------------------------

The implementation of  the algorithm is fairly  straight forward.  The
program  uses a   weighted nilpotent  presentation with definitions to
represent a nilpotent group.  Calculations in the nilpotent  group are
done using a collector from the left without combinatorial collection.
Generators  for  the  c-th   lower central  factor  are    defined  as
commutators of the form [y,x], where x is a generator  of weight 1 and
y  is   a generator of weight c-1.    Then the program calculates  the
necessary changes (tails) for all relations which are not definitions,
runs  through  the consistency   check and evaluates    the   original
relations on the polycyclic presentation.  This gives a list of words,
which have  to   be  made trivial  in  order  to  obtain a  consistent
polycyclic presentation representing a nilpotent quotient of the given
finitely presented   group.  This list   is converted into   a integer
matrix, which  is transformed  into upper   triangular form using  the
Kannan-Bachem  algorithm.  The GNU multiple  precision package is used
for this.


Some improvements planned for further versions
----------------------------------------------

On the agenda for  future versions  of  the program are  the following
items :

    Use combinatorial collection
    Improve the speed of checking the Engel conditions
    Avoid consistency tests used for tail computations
    Speed up elimination of generators and extending the pc pres
    Use column permutations in the Kannan-Bachem algorithm
    Add more comments to the code
    Use the mpz-interface of the GNU multiple precision package
    Find a more satisfying solution for generating sets for each
         central factor.
    Multiple precision integers as exponents of generators
    Better control over the output
    Output computed nilpotent quotient if the program times out
