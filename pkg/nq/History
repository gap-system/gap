Dec 1992: Version 1.0 of the ANU NQ

22 Jan 1993: Version 1.1 of the ANU NQ
	+ introduction of this file and the file README
	+ added option -t to nq
	+ improvements to testNq
	+ added target clean to the make file

26 Feb 1993: Version 1.1b
	+ added the option -a to nq and the corresponding
	  output routine outputMatrix() to glimt.c.

22 Jun 1993: 
	+ The file README has not yet been updated with a
	  description of the option -a. 

12 Aug 1993: Version 1.1c
	+ modified the file engel.c to allow checking of more
	  identities. This entry has been made in Oct 93; it
	  has to be checked what the modifications are and which
	  options have been added.

14 Oct 1993:
	+ changed the functions buildPairs() and buildWord()
	  such that they also build words with negative exponents.
	  This can be switched off using the option -s (s for
	  semigroup words).
	+ Added a check for the identity matrix to the function 
	  addRow(). A flag EarlyStop is set if the check is
	  positive. This flag is now used in the files
	  consistency.c, relations.c and engel.c to stop the
	  computation as soon as all new generators are eliminated.
	+ Fixed the last printing of the total runtime in main().

March 1994:
	+ Version 1.1d
	+ changed the function evalEngel() in engel.c such that it
	  stops checking instances of the Engel law as soon as all
	  instances of a certain weight did not yield anything new.
	  This is not proved to be mathematically sound.
	+ the function buildPairs() in engel.c now checks if an
	  instance [x, ny] of the n-th Engel law is trivial for
	  weight reasons.
	+ the function Collect() in collect.c aborts a run if it
	  runs into an integer overflow.
	+ the functions outputMatrix() and printGapMatrix() in
	  glimt.c have been changed to print only rows and columns
	  whose pivot entry is not 1.
	+ the function MatrixToExpVec() in glimt.c now frees the
	  large matrix row by row.
	+ Update the README file.

04 Aug 1994:
	+ Version 1.1e
	+ fixed printing of preimages in PrintEpim() in relation.c.
	+ the error function of Collect() now prints the generator
	  which caused the error. Collect() was also slightly
	  reformatted.
30 Mar 1995:
	+ added option that allows to check the Engel condition in
	  reverse order

2 Jul 1995:
	+ added -m option that outputs all non-zero vectors handed
	  to addRow() to file.

25 Aug 1995:
	+ built integer overflow check into function Number() in
	  presentation.c .

22 Nov 1995:
	+ replaced the function Commutator() in collect.c.  Instead
	  of using Solve to solve uv x = vu the equation is solved
	  directly. 

27 June 1996:
	+ while MFN was visiting the Magnus group in New York they
	  indicated interest in using this code.  Dmitry Bormotov (their
	  chief programmer) got in contact with me and today I made a copy
	  of the this version of the code available to him via anonymous
	  ftp on gregory.dcs.st-and.ac.uk:pub/werner 

Oct 1996:
	+ Added support for metabelian identities.

Sep 1997:
	+ Added the option -p to toggle the printing of the epimorphism
	  and the nilpotent quotient at the end of a run.  I also added
	  code to print the definitions of each generator of weight at
	  least 2.

Jan 1998:
	+ print statements for the definitions of new generators.
	+ added option -E to reverse the order in which Engel
	  generators are processes.

March 1998:
	+ NQ now reads from stdin when the file name argument is missing

March 1998:
	+ Version 1.2 of the ANU NQ
 
2 Nov 1998:
	+ GAP4 print routines (gap.c) added.  The -g option now
	  prints a pc-presentation in GAP4 style at the end of a
	  run. 

28 Dec 1998:
	+ Evaluation of an Engel identity redefines the Commute
	  array.  As a consequence, commutator calculations are
	  carried out only with the precision required to evaluate
	  an iterated commutator.  This gives a speedup of a factor
	  of 3-4 in Engel-4 and Engel-5 groups.

3 Jan 1999:
	+ Implementation of parsing Engel-n commutators and
	  evaluation of those commutators with redefined Commute[]
	  arrays. 

10 Aug 1999:
	+ turned NQ into a GAP 4 package
	+ modified the GAP 4 output routines

25 Aug 1999:
	+ wrote new setup for nq using autoconf
	+ replaced in glimt.c all BSD compatible integer functions
	  by GMP functions.  Now libmp.a is not needed anymore.

June 2001:
	+ extended the input grammar to accept identical generators
	  as part of the generator list seperated from the other
	  generators by a semicolon
	+ added machinery to evaluate identical relations

June 2002:
	+ added a combinatorial collector
	+ reconstruction of the integer matrix code

October 2002:
	+ rewrite of the examples code

12 February 2003:
	+ The package is released.

21 February 2003:
	+ removed instances of `share package'
	+ removed obsolete files doc/manual.in gap/nqrest.gi

06 February 2007:
	+ filter out the identity word as relator
	+ Release this as version 2.2

17 June 2011:
	+ Remove maintainer flag from Werner, add Max as new maintainer
	+ Sync cnf/config.* files with the ones used by GAP
	+ Include stdlib.h and string.h instead of malloc.h
	+ Do not insist on static linking the nq binary
	+ Drop compatibility with GAP versions prior to 4.4
