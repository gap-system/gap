 This file describes changes in the GAP package 'nq'.
===========================================================================

2.4 (2012-01-12)
	+ Fixed crash on some systems caused by a long standing memory
	  management bug.
	+ Fixed crash on certain systems caused by exponents being sometimes
	  treated as 64bit words, and sometimes as 32bit words.
	+ Fixed spurious warnings when running "configure" that could occur
	  when using --with-gmp-prefix
	+ Fixed a warning when using nq in GAP versions before 4.5.
	+ Improved build system:
	  - Improved GMP detection in configure script; it now checks if GAP
	    built a GMP library, and if so, uses that.
	  - Unified how the user can choose which GAP config to use in the
	    configure script: Instead of a --with-gap-config argument to
	    configure, now a CONFIGNAME environment variable is used. This
	    matches how GAP's own configure script works, and also various
	    other packages.
	  - Added support for ABI override via ABI environment variable
	  - Changed --with-gmp-prefix to --with-gmp, with exact same semantics
	    as the --with-gmp option of GAP's configure.

2.3 (2011-09-15)
	+ Removed maintainer flag from Werner, added Max as new maintainer
	+ Synced cnf/config.* files with the ones used by GAP
	+ Rewrote and improved configure script and the build system
	+ Added '--with-gap-dir' option to configure
	+ Fixed compilation on modern day systems (e.g. Mac OS X),
	  by including stdlib.h and string.h instead of malloc.h 
	+ Stopped insisting on static linking the nq binary
	+ Dropped compatibility with GAP versions prior to 4.4
	+ Made test cases ignore the version string nq outputs
	+ Fixed crash on Mac OS X when compiling in 64 bit mode
	+ Updated documentation
	+ Enabled extra warnings for the C code, and fix many of resulting warnings
	+ Converted History file to this CHANGES file.

2.2 (2007-02-07)
	+ filter out the identity word as relator

2.1 (2003-10-20)
	+ removed instances of `share package'
	+ removed obsolete files doc/manual.in gap/nqrest.gi

2.0 (2003-02-12)
	+ GAP4 print routines (gap.c) added.  The -g option now
	  prints a pc-presentation in GAP4 style at the end of a
	  run. 
	+ Evaluation of an Engel identity redefines the Commute
	  array.  As a consequence, commutator calculations are
	  carried out only with the precision required to evaluate
	  an iterated commutator.  This gives a speedup of a factor
	  of 3-4 in Engel-4 and Engel-5 groups.
	+ Implementation of parsing Engel-n commutators and
	  evaluation of those commutators with redefined Commute[]
	  arrays. 
	+ turned NQ into a GAP 4 package
	+ modified the GAP 4 output routines
	+ wrote new setup for nq using autoconf
	+ replaced in glimt.c all BSD compatible integer functions
	  by GMP functions.  Now libmp.a is not needed anymore.
	+ extended the input grammar to accept identical generators
	  as part of the generator list seperated from the other
	  generators by a semicolon
	+ added machinery to evaluate identical relations
	+ added a combinatorial collector
	+ reconstruction of the integer matrix code
	+ rewrite of the examples code


1.2 (1998-03-??)
	+ added option that allows to check the Engel condition in
	  reverse order
	+ added -m option that outputs all non-zero vectors handed
	  to addRow() to file.
	+ built integer overflow check into function Number() in
	  presentation.c .
	+ replaced the function Commutator() in collect.c.  Instead
	  of using Solve to solve uv x = vu the equation is solved
	  directly. 
	+ Added support for metabelian identities.
	+ Added the option -p to toggle the printing of the epimorphism
	  and the nilpotent quotient at the end of a run.  I also added
	  code to print the definitions of each generator of weight at
	  least 2.
	+ print statements for the definitions of new generators.
	+ added option -E to reverse the order in which Engel
	  generators are processes.
	+ NQ now reads from stdin when the file name argument is missing

1.1e (1994-08-04)
	+ fixed printing of preimages in PrintEpim() in relation.c.
	+ the error function of Collect() now prints the generator
	  which caused the error. Collect() was also slightly
	  reformatted.

1.1d (1994-03-??)
	+ changed the functions buildPairs() and buildWord()
	  such that they also build words with negative exponents.
	  This can be switched off using the option -s (s for
	  semigroup words).
	+ Added a check for the identity matrix to the function 
	  addRow(). A flag EarlyStop is set if the check is
	  positive. This flag is now used in the files
	  consistency.c, relations.c and engel.c to stop the
	  computation as soon as all new generators are eliminated.
	+ Fixed the last printing of the total runtime in main().
	+ changed the function evalEngel() in engel.c such that it
	  stops checking instances of the Engel law as soon as all
	  instances of a certain weight did not yield anything new.
	  This is not proved to be mathematically sound.
	+ the function buildPairs() in engel.c now checks if an
	  instance [x, ny] of the n-th Engel law is trivial for
	  weight reasons.
	+ the function Collect() in collect.c aborts a run if it
	  runs into an integer overflow.
	+ the functions outputMatrix() and printGapMatrix() in
	  glimt.c have been changed to print only rows and columns
	  whose pivot entry is not 1.
	+ the function MatrixToExpVec() in glimt.c now frees the
	  large matrix row by row.
	+ Update the README file.

1.1c (1993-08-12)
	+ modified the file engel.c to allow checking of more
	  identities. This entry has been made in Oct 93; it
	  has to be checked what the modifications are and which
	  options have been added.

1.1b (1993-02-26)
	+ added the option -a to nq and the corresponding
	  output routine outputMatrix() to glimt.c.

1.1 (1993-01-22)
	+ introduction of this file and the file README
	+ added option -t to nq
	+ improvements to testNq
	+ added target clean to the make file

1.0 (1992-12-??)
	+ Version 1.0 of the ANU NQ
