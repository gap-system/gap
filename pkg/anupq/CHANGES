In this file we record the changes since the first GAP 4 release of
the ANUPQ package.

Version 3.0:
   o lib/{anupga.gi,anupq.gi,anupqprop.gi,anupqxdesc.gi}:
       deprecated `PrimeOfPGroup' replaced by `PrimePGroup'
   o lib/anusp.gi:
       improved non-isomorphism test in `IsPqIsomorphicPGroup' from 
       checking the exponent-p length to checking the order of the
       terms in the lower exponent-p central series (suggested by
       Marco Costantini), and corrected by Jack Schmidt
   o pre-GAP 4.4 compatibility features removed:
       - lib/anupqhead.g:
         . banner removed ... this role is performed by PackageInfo.g
           since GAP 4.4; thus `pkgbanner' option no longer exists
         . file split into lib/anupqhead.gd and lib/anupqhead.gi
       - lib/anupq4r2cpt.g[di]:
           (GAP 4.2 compatibility) deleted from distribution
       - lib/anustab.gi:
           changed `AutPGrp' package test to corresponding GAP 4.4 test
       - read.g,init.g:
           . removed all but the `ReadPkg' commands 
           . changed `ReadPkg' to `ReadPackage'
           . made adjustments for lib/anupqhead.g split
   o src/GAP_link_via_file.c:
       deprecated GAP code updated for version 4.4
   o include/pq_author.h:
       pq program is now version 1.8
   o standalone-doc/{README,guide.tex}:
       modified for version 1.8 of the pq program
   o testPq.in
       - updated to check for GAP 4.4 and AutPGrp 1.2 as minimum versions
       - now also checks the version of the pq program
   o PackageInfo.g,README,VERSION,doc/{manual,intro,infra,install}.tex:
       - package version changed from 2.2 to 3.0
       - AutPGrp package (at least 1.2) is now essential, not just
         recommended
       - pq program now version 1.8
Version 2.2:
   o PackageInfo.g, README, VERSION, doc/{intro,infra,install}.tex:
       - fixed typo. in PackageInfo.g: test file is tst/anupqeg.tst
       - package version changed from 2.1 to 2.2
Version 2.1:
   o lib/anupqi, tst/anupqeg.tst
       fix for a bug discovered by Tobias Roﬂmann: this bug was caused
       in the ANUPQ package's interface by not passing on the parameter
       StepSize to the standalone properly.  This bug could result in
       computing the wrong number of descendants.  Produced a new
       test file
   o lib/anupqi.gi, Makefile.in, tst/anupqeg.tsk, tst/anupqeg.tst
       changes suggested by Gary Zablackis in order to make the package
       run under Windows:
         - use '[grp]' as intermediate filename instead of '<grp>'
         - add target to the makefile for compiling the standalone
           with cygwin 
         - run PqQuitAll() more often in test example
   o src/store_definition_sets.c:
       binomial coefficient algorithm modified to avoid overflow
   o include/pq_author.h:
       pq program is now version 1.7
   o standalone-doc/{README,guide.tex}:
       modified for version 1.7 of the pq program
   o PackageInfo.g, README, VERSION, 
     doc/{manual,intro,infra,anupq,options,install}.tex:
       - package version changed from 2.0 to 2.1
       - pq program version changed from 1.6 to 1.7
Version 2.0:
   o include/pq_author.h:
       pq program is now version 1.6
   o src/GAP_link_via_file.c:
       newline now added to output to GAP
   o src/{GAP_present.c,pgroup.c},
     lib/{anupga.gi,anupqi.gi,anustab.gi}:
       changes to remedy bug reported by Boris Girnat (thanks Boris!)
       where too many descendants were generated for a group of class
       more than 1 with insoluble automorphism group
   o standalone/examples/README:
       updated with version 1.6 change 
   o standalone/examples/pga_*, tst/test[123].pga:
       each file modified due to version 1.6 change
       (pq now asks an additional question: how many soluble automorphisms?
       - for all pga examples answer is 0)
   o standalone-doc/{README,guide.tex}:
       modified for version 1.6 of the pq program
   o tst/out/test[123].out
       modified as per above
   o examples/PqSupplementInnerAutomorphisms:
       `PqSupplementInnerAutomorphisms' now returns a record rather than
       a group; example modified accordingly
   o lib/anupq.gi:
       `GAPInfo.DirectoriesTemporary' replaces `DIRECTORIES_TEMPORARY'
   o lib/anupqopt.gi:
       added two new options for `PqPGSupplyAutomorphisms', namely
       `NumberOfSolubleAutomorphisms' and `RelativeOrders'
   o README, VERSION, 
     doc/{manual,intro,infra,anupq,options,install}.tex:
       - package version changed from 1.5 to 2.0
       - pq program version changed from 1.5 to 1.6
       - various GAP 4.4 documentation changes
       - `PqSupplementInnerAutomorphisms' example modified

   o init.g:
       - for GAP 4.3 compatibility, if GAP 4.3 then
          `GAPInfo' record defined with entries:
            . `DirectoriesTemporary' defined to be `DIRECTORIES_TEMPORARY'
            . `Version' which is defined to be the contents of VERSION
       - commented out deprecated stuff deleted
       - undocumented ANUPQPackageVersion() function removed

       now includes doc/manual.{lab,toc}
   o tst/anupqeg.tst:
       modified for `PqSupplementInnerAutomorphisms' change
Version 1.5:
   o lib/anupqios.gi:
       typo. (and bug!) on line 541 fixed (1 changed to i);
       thanks to Robert Morse for spotting it.
   o PkgInfo.g, lib/anupqhead.g:
       banner generated by `BannerString' field of PkgInfo.g
       record, rather than by lib/anupqhead.g for GAP 4.4+.
   o README, VERSION, PkgInfo.g, doc/{install,intro,infra}.tex
       1.4 changed to 1.5
Version 1.4:
   o src/malloc.h: 
       debugging file removed
   o src/print_multiweight.c: 
       removed unnecessary line: #include <malloc.h>
   o README, VERSION, PkgInfo.g, doc/{install,intro,infra}.tex
       1.3 changed to 1.4
   o testPq.in:
       Added more bullet-proofing, and more intelligent messages when 
       things go wrong
Version 1.3:
   o init.g:
       - now use `StringFile' rather than iostreams to read `VERSION' 
         (more efficient)
       - now looks for version 1.1 of AutPGrp
   o testPq.in:
       - Added -A option to GAP command.
       - now looks for version 1.1 of AutPGrp 
   o lib/{anusp.gi,anupga.gi}:
       On suggestion of Alexander Hulpke added `IsSyllableWordsFamily'
       as first argument to `FreeGroup' commands when the group is
       subsequently converted to a pc group (more efficient)
   o tst/anupqeg.tst:
       Remade.
   o doc/basics.tex:
       Fixed typo.
   o README, VERSION, PkgInfo.g, doc/{install,intro,infra}.tex
       1.2 changed to 1.3
Version 1.2:
   A number of bugs to do with the input of generators/relations were
   identified by Robert Morse (thanks Robert):
   o PQ_GROUP_FROM_PCP (lib/anupq.gi line 531):
       `GroupHomomorphismByImages' replaced by `GroupHomomorphismByImagesNC'
       Reason: The check was unnecessary and slowed things down enormously.
   o PQ_PC_PRESENTATION (lib/anupq.gi):
       - datarec.gens, datarec.rels: previously `String' was applied to
         the generators/relators provided and then stored in datarec.gens,
         datarec.rels; this can be enormously costly. Now, no processing
         is done when GAP already has them in another form (for pc groups,
         however, the relators are calculated as before and stored as
         strings, in datec.rels). The conversion to String is now only done
         at the point of transmission to the pq program, and done in `ToPQk'.
       - datarec.gens: an Error is now emitted if the number of defining gen'rs
         is larger than 511 (the limit imposed by the pq program, see MAXGENS
         in `include/runtime.h').
   o ToPQk (lib/anupqios.gi):
       When `ToPQk' is called with `cmd' equal to "gens" or "rels", cmd is
       treated as the field of `datarec' so that the transmission of generators
       and relators to the pq program can be treated specially, to improve 
       efficiency. The data is still split into ``nice'' lines of length < 69
       characters, but care is taken to avoid infinite loops when there are
       no nice places to break the lines.
   Also updated for changes made in GAP 4.3fix4. 
   o PqSupplementInnerAutomorphisms (lib/anupga.gi):
       `SetPcgs' changed to `SetGeneralizedPcgs'.
   o PQ_AUT_INPUT (lib/anupqi.gi):
       `Pcgs' changed to `GeneralizedPcgs'.
   Now requires at least GAP 4.3fix4 and updated AutPGrp package 
   (in .../autpgrp/gap/autos.gi `ConvertHybridAutGroup' uses 
   `SetGeneralizedPcgs' in lieu of `SetPcgs'.)
   o lib/anupq4r2cpt.g[id]: 
       deprecated.
   o init.g:
       commented out backward compatibility with GAP 4.2, since version 1.2
       requires GAP 4.3fix4 anyway.
   Updated:
   o testPq.in:
       checks for new requirements mentioned above.
   o make_zoo
   o README
   o doc/{intro.tex,install.tex}
   Added:
   o PkgInfo.g

Version 1.1:
  First GAP 4 release (GAP 4.2 compatible). Updates the GAP 3 release
  (Version 1.0). Basically, Version 1.0 and 1.1 are incompatible, being
  for different versions of GAP, but as much as was feasible of the original 
  was retained. Principal differences are: 
   o the key commands all take one argument, with any of the previous 
     arguments being input as options; the GAP 3 way of inputting arguments is
     still supported for Pq, PqEpimorphism, PqDescendants etc.;
   o iostreams are used instead of files to communicate with the pq program;
   o the source code has been modified to support a -G option that allows the
     pq program to communicate with GAP via the iostream, rather than start
     up a new GAP, when it needs GAP to compute stabilisers;
   o the source code has also been modified to remove a few bugs;
   o the functionality has been significantly increased.
