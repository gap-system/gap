a solvable, rational polynomial.
Related to this it is possible to create the Galois group and the splitting
field of a rational polynomial.

Requirements:
------------

The package is written for GAP version 4.4 or higher. It requires the package
'Alnuth' in version 2.2.3 or higher. Beside this the external programms 'LaTeX'
and 'xdvi' are recommended.
