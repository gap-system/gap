Remember a projective method to check whether it is the trivial group!
Make sure that projective leaf nodes do report "Size" correctly!
document isequal and isone
Is leavegensNuntouched documented?
Is nrgensH documented?
Do more tests before embarking into Tensor?


TensorInduced:

 - assume: low index already ran
   if the action on one tensor factor has a small degree permrep, then
   low index might have found r* this one.

 - Look at dimension to guess r
 - Let l := LCM(Exponents of primitive groups on r points)
 - Create random elements in G, power up with l
 - Take Fast Normal closure
 - check reducibility, clifford gives permrep or tensor
 - otherwise hope that this is tensor decomposable and our method is
   applicable
 - check whether tensor decomp is respected by the entire group.
