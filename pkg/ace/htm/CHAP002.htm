<h2><a name="SECT001">2.1 Installing the ACE Package</a></h2>
<p><p>
To install, unpack the archive file, which should have a name of  form
<code>ace-</code><var>XXX</var><code>.zoo</code>  for  some  package  version  number   <var>XXX</var>,   as   a
sub-directory in the <code>pkg</code> hierarchy of your version of <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>&nbsp;4. This
might be the <code>pkg</code> directory of the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>&nbsp;4  home  directory;  it  is
however also possible to keep an additional <code>pkg</code>  directory  in  your
private directories. The only  essential  difference  with  installing
<font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">ACE</font> in a <code>pkg</code> directory different to the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>&nbsp;4  home  directory
is  that  one  must  start  <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>   with   the   <code>-l</code>   switch   (see
Section&nbsp;<a href="../../../doc/htm/ref/CHAP003.htm#SECT001">Command  Line  Options</a>),  e.g.&nbsp;if  your  private   <code>pkg</code>
directory is a subdirectory of <code>mygap</code>  in  your  home  directory  you
might type:
<p>
<code>gap -l ";</code><var>myhomedir</var><code>/mygap"</code>
<p>
where <var>myhomedir</var> is the path to your  home  directory,  which  (since
<font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>&nbsp;4.3) may be replaced by a tilde.  The  empty  path  before  the
semicolon is filled in by  the  default  path  of  the  <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>&nbsp;4  home
directory.
<p>
After unpacking the archive, go to the newly created  <code>ace</code>  directory
and call <code>./configure </code><var>path</var><code></code> where <var>path</var> is the path to  the  <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>
home directory. So for example if you install the package in the  main
<code>pkg</code> directory call
<p>
<pre>
./configure ../..
</pre>
<p>
This  will fetch  the  architecture  type for  which  <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> has  been
compiled last and create a <code>Makefile</code>. Now simply call
<p>
<pre>
make
</pre>
<p>
to compile the binary and to install it in the appropriate place.
<p>
Note that the  current version of the configuration  process only sets
up  directory paths.  If you  need a  different compiler  or different
compiler options, you need to edit <code>src/Makefile.in</code>  yourself,  prior
to calling <code>make</code>.
<p>
If you use this installation of <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> on different hardware platforms
you will have to compile the binary for each platform separately. This
is done by calling <code>configure</code>,  editing  <code>src/Makefile.in</code>  possibly,
and calling <code>make</code> for the package anew  immediately  after  compiling
<font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> itself for the respective  architecture.  If  your  version  of
<font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> is already compiled (and has last been  compiled  on  the  same
architecture)  you  do  not  need  to  compile  <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>  again,  it  is
sufficient  to  call  the  <code>configure</code>  script  in  the  <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>   home
directory.
<p>
The manual you are currently reading describes how to use  the  <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">ACE</font>
Package; it can be found in the <code>doc</code> subdirectory of the package.  If
your manual does not have a table of contents or index, or  has  these
but with  invalid  page  numbers  please  re-generate  the  manual  by
executing
<p>
<pre>
./make_doc
</pre>
<p>
in the <code>doc</code> subdirectory.
<p>
The subdirectory <code>standalone-doc</code> contains the file <code>ace3001.ps</code> which
holds a version of the user manual for the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">ACE</font> standalone; it forms
part of&nbsp;<a href="biblio.htm#Ram99"><cite>Ram99</cite></a>). You should consult  it  if  you  are  going  to
switch to  the  <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">ACE</font>  standalone,  e.g.&nbsp;in  order  to  directly  use
interactive facilities.
<p>
The  <code>src</code> subdirectory  contains a  copy  of the  original source  of
<font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">ACE</font>.  (The  only modification  is  that  a  file <code>Makefile.in</code>  was
obtained from  the different <code>make.xyz</code> and  will be used  to create a
<code>Makefile</code>.)  You  can replace  the source by  a newer  version before
compiling.
<p>
If you encounter problems in installation please read the <code>README</code>.

<h2><a name="SECT002">2.2 Loading the ACE Package</a></h2>
<p><p>
To use the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">ACE</font> Package you have  to  request  it  explicitly.  With
<font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> 4.4, this is done by calling
<p>
<pre>
gap&gt; LoadPackage("ace");

In version 4.1 of the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">ACE</font> package there was an  option  <code>pkgbanner</code>
that allowed the user  some  control  on  how  the  banner  above  was
displayed. This only worked with <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>&nbsp;4.3. Since, the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">ACE</font> package
now requires at least <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>&nbsp;4.4, this option has been removed. If you
still have <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>&nbsp;4.3, you will need to use <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">ACE</font>&nbsp;4.1.
<p>

The banner may be suppressed by providing the version string (<code>"5.0"</code>)
as second argument and <code>false</code> as third argument to the  <code>LoadPackage</code>
command.    The    <code>LoadPackage</code>    command    is     described     in
Section&nbsp;<a href="../../../doc/htm/ref/CHAP075.htm#SSEC002.1">LoadPackage</a> in the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> Reference Manual.
<p>
If <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> cannot find a working binary, the call to <code>LoadPackage</code> will
fail.
<p>
If you want to load the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">ACE</font> package by default,  you  can  put  the
<code>LoadPackage</code> command into your <code>.gaprc</code>  file  (see  Section&nbsp;<a href="../../../doc/htm/ref/CHAP003.htm#SECT004">The .gaprc file</a> in the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> Reference Manual).
