# These are patterns to classify files in a checked out GAP root
# directory according to whether they are shipped with the main 
# archive, with the tools archive or not at all.
# Lines starting with # are ignored, lines starting with - are
# patterns for files not to be shipped, lines starting with + 
# are patterns files to be shipped with the main archive and
# lines starting with a T are patterns for files to be shipped
# with the tools archive. The first match decides about the class.
#
# some problematic files which we need:
# (in particular there are files with extension .o and .a)
# files and directories we never include
-*.o
-*.cvsignore*
-*CVS/*
-*.git/*
# excluded directories 
-bin/*
-gap/*
-htm/*
# included directories
+doc/*
+lib/*
+tst/*
# individual files
+CHANGES
+README
+configure
+Makefile.in
+*.g
+src/hello.c
# the rest is excluded
