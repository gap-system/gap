           Some reminders for the authors

- should the bibliography and the index appear in the table of contents?
  (if yes, in all output versions) 
  [use: \addcontentsline{toc}{section}{References}   ?]

- allow the distribution of different output documents (html, text, pdf,...)
  into different directories (needs to change the handler for GAPDoc books).

- think about combining index entries, when they point to the same section
  (e.g., a function with several types of arguments, where the entries are
  only distinguished by the 'Label' attribute and are explained in the same
  man section).

- add colors to "Example"s as with ColorPrompt("true"); (use 'commandchars'
  option in Verbatim from fancyvrb for LaTeX version). (use  CSS in XHTML:
  set monospace fonts and colors, see output of TOhtml in vim)

- with GAP 4.5 substitute the 'POST_RESTORE_FUNCS' in init.g by
  GAPInfo.PostRestoreFuncs.

- investigate using xelatex and direct unicode input for the LaTeX version.
