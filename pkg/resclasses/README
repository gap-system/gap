                                  Abstract

ResClasses is  a GAP 4 package for  set-theoretic computations  with  residue
classes of the integers and a couple of other rings.  The class of sets which
ResClasses can deal with  includes the open and the closed sets in the  topo-
logy on the respective ring which is induced by taking the set of all residue
classes as a basis,  as far as the usual restrictions  imposed by the finite-
ness of computing resources permit this.
    For details on how to use the  ResClasses package,  see the package docu-
mentation  in  the  `doc'  subdirectory  --  either  view  its  HTML  version
(chap0.html)  with  a browser,  or its  PDF version  (manual.pdf)  with a PDF
viewer.


                                Requirements

This version of ResClasses  needs at least  GAP 4.5.2 and  Polycyclic 2.6, is
completely written  in the GAP language  and does neither contain nor require
external binaries.  GAPDoc 1.4  or higher is needed for displaying the online
help.


                                Installation

Like any other  GAP package,  ResClasses must  be installed in the  pkg/ sub-
directory of the  GAP distribution.   This is accomplished  by extracting the
package archive file in this directory.  After this  you can load the package
as usual via LoadPackage( "resclasses" );.
  For further advice  on questions of technical nature  please see the  chap-
ter `Installation and Auxiliary Functions' in the manual.


                          Distribution and Updates

New releases of this package are put online on the package web page

                                     ---

If you install ResClasses or if you use it in some of your work,  then please
let me know.  Also please let me know if you have problems with this package,
or if you find a bug.
