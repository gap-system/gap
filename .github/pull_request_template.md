1. If this PR shall **not** be mentioned in the release notes, write "none" here.
2. If a brief note suffices, edit the title of this PR to be usable as entry in `CHANGES.md`, and write "see title" here (or if you have the required permissions, add the label `release notes: use title` to this PR and remove this section)
