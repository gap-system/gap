GAP Examples
============

The book
[Representations of Groups - A Computational Approach](https://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~RepresentationsOfGroups/)
contains several examples involving GAP code.

The testfiles in this directory contain the input and output
for those examples for which the book shows GAP output.

Some of the exercises in the book, such as Exercise 2.10.1,
provide GAP functions which are used later in examples.
These functions are contained in the testfiles in question.

Example 2.7.11 in the book is continued in the examples 2.8.2 and 2.8.12.
Input and output for all three examples are contained in the file
`example_2.7.11.tst`.
