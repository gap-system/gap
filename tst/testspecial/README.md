These tests are designed to check GAP's output in the break loop.

Most of the cleverness is in `./run_gap.sh`, where we make sure we capture
all of GAP's output, stop GAP attaching to the terminal, and rewrite any
filenames which occur in output.

`./run_gap.sh` : This runs GAP, capturing it's input/output
`./run_all.sh` : This runs all the tests
`./regenerate_tests.sh` : Regenerate all outputs
