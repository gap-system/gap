#!/usr/bin/env bash

# This script attempts to build all GAP packages contained in the current
# directory. Normally, you should run this script from the 'pkg'
# subdirectory of your GAP installation.

# You can also run it from other locations, but then you need to tell the
# script where your GAP root directory is, by passing it as first argument
# to the script with '--with-gaproot='. By default, the script assumes that
# the parent of the current working directory is the GAP root directory.

# If arguments are added, then they are considered packages. In that case
# only these packages will be built, and all others are ignored.

# You need at least 'gzip', GNU 'tar', a C compiler, sed, pdftex to run this.
# Some packages also need a C++ compiler.

# Contact support@gap-system.org for questions and complaints.

# Note, that this isn't and is not intended to be a sophisticated script.
# Even if it doesn't work completely automatically for you, you may get
# an idea what to do for a complete installation of GAP.
