# subdirectory of your GAP installation.

# You can also run it from other locations, but then you need to tell the
# script where your GAP root directory is, by passing it as first argument
# to the script. By default, the script assumes that the parent of the
# current working directory is the GAP root directory.

# You need at least 'gzip', GNU 'tar', a C compiler, sed, pdftex to run this.
# Some packages also need a C++ compiler.

# Contact support@gap-system.org for questions and complaints.

# Note, that this isn't and is not intended to be a sophisticated script.
# Even if it doesn't work completely automatically for you, you may get
# an idea what to do for a complete installation of GAP.

packages which fail to build correctly, and only worry about packages
