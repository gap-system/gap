#
# This Makefile serves two purposes:
# 1) If the user types "make" without having run "configure", we suggest running configure.
# 2) Our build system is written for GNU make, and makes liberal users of its features.
#    We therefore put it into "GNUmakefile", which is picked up by GNU make, but ignore by
#    other make versions, such as BSD make.
#    Thus, if the user has BSD make, it will run this Makefile instead -- and we inform
#    them that they need to use GNU make to compile GAP.
#
# To learn more about the GAP build system, see README.buildsys.md
